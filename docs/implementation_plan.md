## Game Scale Definition

The physical game uses these real-world measurements:

| Physical Component | Real-World Size | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Range ruler | 1 foot (305mm) | Divided into 3 range bands (close/medium/long) and 5 distance bands (1–5) |
| Play area (Learning) | 3' × 3' (914mm × 914mm) | Play area = 3 × range ruler length per side |
| Small ship base | ~43mm × 71mm | CR90, Nebulon-B |
| Medium ship base | ~63mm × 102mm | Victory-class |
| Squadron base | ~34.2mm diameter (circular) | X-wing, TIE Fighter |
| Maneuver tool segment | ~61mm per segment | 5 segments, each ~1/5 of range ruler |

### How Scale Is Determined

The user provides a PNG of the range ruler and measures its **total length in pixels**. This establishes the master scale:

```
PIXELS_PER_FOOT = range_ruler_total_length_in_pixels
PLAY_AREA_PIXELS = PIXELS_PER_FOOT * 3   (for 3' × 3')
```

All other component sizes derive from this single measurement:

| Component | Scale Formula |
|-----------|---------------|
| Play area side | `PIXELS_PER_FOOT × 3` |
| Close range band | Range ruler band 1 boundary (measured from PNG) |
| Medium range band | Range ruler band 2 boundary (measured from PNG) |
| Long range band | Range ruler band 3 boundary = full ruler |
| Distance band N | Range ruler distance band N boundary (measured from PNG) |
| Small base width | `PIXELS_PER_FOOT × (43/305)` ≈ 0.141 × ruler |
| Small base length | `PIXELS_PER_FOOT × (71/305)` ≈ 0.233 × ruler |
| Medium base width | `PIXELS_PER_FOOT × (63/305)` ≈ 0.207 × ruler |
| Medium base length | `PIXELS_PER_FOOT × (102/305)` ≈ 0.334 × ruler |
| Squadron base diameter | `PIXELS_PER_FOOT × (34.2/305)` ≈ 0.112 × ruler |
| Maneuver segment length | `PIXELS_PER_FOOT / 5` |

> **ACTION REQUIRED:** Measure the range ruler PNG (total length in pixels) and provide the pixel positions of each band boundary. See `Resources/Game_Components/scale/README.md` for the exact measurements needed.

## Graphic Assets Required

Assets are classified as **User-Provided PNGs** or **Procedural** (generated by code).

### User-Provided PNGs (Must Exist Before Implementation)

These assets require artistic work and cannot be generated programmatically with acceptable quality.

#### Ship Tokens (Top-Down View)

These are **play area tokens** — NOT the card images already in `ships/`. They represent the miniatures as seen from above on the game mat.

| Asset | Filename | Size Guidance | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------|
| CR90 Corvette A | `cr90_corvette_a_token.png` | Small base proportions (43:71 ratio) | Top-down silhouette, Rebel styling |
| Nebulon-B Escort | `nebulon_b_escort_frigate_token.png` | Small base proportions (43:71 ratio) | Top-down silhouette, Rebel styling |
| Victory II-class SD | `victory_ii_class_star_destroyer_token.png` | Medium base proportions (63:102 ratio) | Top-down silhouette, Imperial styling |

- Transparent background (PNG with alpha)
- Ship art only — no base, no firing arc lines (those are procedural overlays)
- Orientation: ship nose pointing **up** (toward Y-negative in Godot 2D)
- Resolution: at least 2× the expected display size for crisp rendering at zoom

#### Squadron Tokens (Two-Layer Composite)

Squadrons use **two** separate graphics: a shared circular base (`squad_base.png`, 82×82 px) and a per-squadron token artwork PNG drawn on top. The base determines game-scale sizing (range measurement, overlap detection). The token artwork is purely visual.

| Asset | Filename | Size (px) | Notes |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Shared base | `squad_base.png` | 82×82 (circle) | Scaled to game-scale diameter; defines collision/range circle |
| X-wing token | `x_wing_squadron_token.png` | 74×63 (content) | Drawn on top of base, fit within circle |
| TIE Fighter token | `tie_fighter_squadron_token.png` | 70×51 (content) | Drawn on top of base, fit within circle |

- Transparent backgrounds (PNG with alpha)
- Token artwork: no base circle — the shared base PNG provides it
- Orientation: nose pointing **up**

#### Play Area

| Asset | Filename | Size Guidance | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------|
| Space background | `space_background.png` | 3:3 aspect ratio, at least 2048×2048 | Star field, can tile or be a single large image |

Alternatively, the existing map JPGs in `Resources/Game_Components/maps/` could be cropped/adapted.

#### Range Ruler

| Asset | Filename | Size Guidance | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------|
| Range ruler (range side) | `range_ruler_range.png` | Full length, proportional | Shows close/medium/long bands with markings |
| Range ruler (distance side) | `range_ruler_distance.png` | Full length, proportional | Shows distance bands 1–5 with markings |

These serve double duty: (1) visual overlay for measurement and (2) scale calibration source.

#### Dice Faces

| Asset | Filename Pattern | Count | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|-------|
| Red die faces | `die_red_<face>.png` | 4 faces | blank, hit, hit_hit, crit |
| Blue die faces | `die_blue_<face>.png` | 4 faces | blank, hit, accuracy, hit_crit |
| Black die faces | `die_black_<face>.png` | 4 faces | blank, hit, hit_hit, crit |

> **Alternative:** Dice faces can be **procedural** (colored square + icon symbols drawn in code). If you prefer this, these PNGs can be skipped. See question below.

#### Defense Token Icons

| Asset | Filename Pattern | States | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Evade | `token_evade_ready.png` / `token_evade_exhausted.png` | Ready + exhausted PNGs provided |
| Redirect | `token_redirect_ready.png` / `token_redirect_exhausted.png` | Ready + exhausted PNGs provided |
| Brace | `token_brace_ready.png` / `token_brace_exhausted.png` | Ready + exhausted PNGs provided |
| Scatter | `token_scatter_ready.png` / `token_scatter_exhausted.png` | Ready + exhausted PNGs provided |
| Contain | `token_contain_ready.png` / `token_contain_exhausted.png` | Ready + exhausted PNGs provided |

> All 10 defense token PNGs (5 types × ready/exhausted) are already in `defense_tokens/`.

#### Command Icons

| Asset | Filename Pattern | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Navigate icon | `cmd_navigate.png` | Arrow/compass icon |
| Squadron icon | `cmd_squadron.png` | Fighter icon |
| Repair icon | `cmd_repair.png` | Wrench icon |
| Concentrate Fire icon | `cmd_concentrate_fire.png` | Crosshair icon |

> All 4 command token PNGs are already in `command_tokens/`.

#### Initiative Token

| Asset | Filename | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Initiative (Rebel side) | `initiative_rebel.png` | Blue with ★ icon |
| Initiative (Imperial side) | `initiative_imperial.png` | Red/grey side |

### Procedural Components (Generated by Code)

These will be drawn/composed programmatically. No PNGs needed.

| Component | Approach | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Ship bases** | `Polygon2D` + `Line2D` | Rectangles with firing arc lines, hull zone coloring, notch markers |
| **Squadron bases** | `Polygon2D` (circle) | Colored ring with faction tint |
| **Maneuver tool** | `Line2D` segments + joints | Interactive: click joints to set yaw |
| **Speed dial** | `Control` widget | Numeric display with +/- buttons |
| **Shield dials** | `Control` widget per hull zone | Current/max display, color-coded |
| **Activation slider** | Toggle `Control` | Blue/other color state |
| **Round counter** | `Label` widget | Number 1–6 |
| **Damage deck** | Data-driven `Control` | Card back + faceup effect text from data |
| **Firing arc overlay** | `Line2D` + shader | Semi-transparent wedges extending from hull zones |
| **Range measurement overlay** | `Line2D` + colored bands | Draggable for player measurement |
| **Engagement lines** | `Line2D` | Visual links between engaged squadrons |
| **Attack step dialog** | `Control` panels | Step-by-step UI for attack resolution |
| **Command dial picker** | `Control` widget | 4-way selector, hidden from opponent |
| **HUD** | `CanvasLayer` + `Control` | Phase, round, scores, active player |

### Summary: Minimum PNGs Needed

| Category | Count | Can Skip If Procedural? |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Ship tokens (top-down) | 3 | No — art needed |
| Squadron tokens (top-down) | 2 | No — art needed |
| Space background | 1 | Could use existing map JPGs |
| Range ruler (both sides) | 2 | No — also used for scale calibration |
| Dice faces | 0–24 | Yes — can be procedural |
| Defense token icons | 0–4 | Already provided (10 PNGs in `defense_tokens/`) |
| Command icons | 0–4 | Already provided (4 PNGs in `command_tokens/`) |
| Initiative token | 0–2 | Yes — can be procedural |
| **Hard minimum** | **8 PNGs** | Ship tokens + squadron tokens + background + range rulers |

## Implementation Phases

> **Progress Key:** ✅ Complete · 🔄 In Progress · ⏳ Not Started

### Phase 0: Scale & Assets Foundation ✅
**Status:** Complete — committed `3343768`
**Goal:** Establish the pixel-to-game-unit scale and verify all assets load correctly.
**Prerequisites:** All user-provided PNGs in place.

| Task | Status | Deliverable |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Define `GameScale` autoload | ✅ | `src/autoload/game_scale.gd` |
| Asset validation utility | ✅ | `src/utils/asset_loader.gd` |
| Scale calibration tests | ✅ | `tests/unit/test_game_scale.gd` (28 tests) |
| Asset loader tests | ✅ | `tests/unit/test_asset_loader.gd` (21 tests) |

**Requirements covered:** SU-001 (scale), SU-003 (asset loading)
**Tests delivered:** 49 new (180 total, all passing)

#### Scale Centralisation Refactoring

All physical dimensions (mm values) are now centralised in
`Resources/Game_Components/scale/scale_config.json` under the
`physical_dimensions_mm` section. GDScript files no longer contain
hardcoded mm constants — `GameScale` loads everything from JSON at
startup. The refactoring removed 10 hardcoded constants from
`game_scale.gd` and 6 duplicate constants from `constants.gd`.

**Changed files:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `scale_config.json` | Added `physical_dimensions_mm` section (ruler, bases, squadron, segments, multiplier) |
| `game_scale.gd` | Replaced 10 `const` values with vars loaded from JSON; added `_load_physical_dimensions()`, `_compute_derived_values()`, `_load_base_graphics()` helpers |
| `constants.gd` | Removed 6 mm constants (`RULER_LENGTH_MM`, ship base mm values, `SQUADRON_BASE_DIAMETER_MM`) |

### Phase 2b: Debug Token Placement ✅
**Goal:** Interactive token drag/rotate with deployment zone enforcement and position persistence for development and visual testing during setup.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 (geometry for overlap detection), Phase 2 (tokens on board)
**Duration estimate:** 2 sessions
**Completed:** 2025-03-14 · 23 scripts · 362 tests · 780 asserts

| Task | Layer | Requirements | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `DebugMode` autoload — global toggle + state | Autoload | DBG-001, DBG-002 | `src/autoload/debug_mode.gd` ✅ |

| Camera conflict prevention | Presentation | DBG-003 | Input routing: debug drag vs camera pan ✅ |

#### Collision Resolution Refactoring

The original implementation used binary-search along the **movement vector**
(current_pos → desired_pos) to find a contact point, plus a separate "jump-past"
step. This was replaced with **projection-based push-out** (DBG-020 revised, DBG-022):

- When a token at the desired (mouse) position overlaps a blocker, the resolver
  computes the nearest non-overlapping position by projecting outward from the
  **blocker's centre** along the direction toward the **mouse cursor**.
- For circle↔circle: exact Minkowski formula (no binary search).
- For ship↔ship and ship↔circle: binary search along the blocker→mouse ray.
- For circle←ship: closest-point-on-polygon + radial push.
- Among all push-out candidates, the one closest to the mouse that satisfies
  all constraints (other tokens, deployment zone, play area) is returned.
- Jump-past (former DBG-021) is subsumed: if the mouse is beyond a blocker and
  the footprint fits, the desired position is returned directly (step 2).

**Tests:** 16 token_mover tests (14 original + 3 new projection tests − 1 renamed) — 23 scripts, 365 tests, 786 asserts.

---

### Phase 2c: Debug Mode — Relaxed Deployment Zones ✅
**Goal:** Allow tokens to be dragged outside their deployment zone in debug mode (advisory-only zone boundaries). Show a toast warning when a dragged token leaves its zone. Preserve all zone validation logic for full-game enforcement later.

### Phase L: Game Logging Tooling ✅
**Goal:** Extend the existing `GameLogger` utility with optional file-based output, activated by a `--logging` CLI flag. Log all game flow events (phase transitions, active player changes, command dial assignments, activations, auto-pass) to a timestamped file for debugging.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 4b (turn management signals exist)
**Duration estimate:** 1 session
**Completed:** 672 tests passing (43 scripts, 1316 asserts)

| Task | Layer | Requirements | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `LoggingMode` autoload | Autoload | LOG-001 | `src/autoload/logging_mode.gd` — parses `--logging` CLI flag, exposes `LoggingMode.enabled` |
| Extend `GameLogger` with file output | Utils | LOG-002, LOG-003, LOG-005 | Add optional `FileAccess` sink to `GameLogger._log()`; open/flush/close lifecycle |

### Post-Phase-L Bug Fixes ✅
**Goal:** Address issues discovered during manual playtesting of the Phase 4b/L hot-seat flow.
**Completed:** 672 tests passing (43 scripts, 1316 asserts)

| Commit | Fix | Layer | Details |
|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| `581e030` | Double phase advance on dial submission | Application | `_on_command_picker_confirmed` emitted `command_dials_submitted` AND called `_check_command_phase_complete()` — synchronous signal delivery caused double advance (Command → Ship → Squadron). Removed redundant call; added defensive phase guard. +1 regression test. |
| `4c3d2dd` | Camera not rotating for player switch | Presentation | `Camera2D.ignore_rotation` defaults to `true` in Godot 4; tween animated `rotation` but viewport ignored it. Set `ignore_rotation = false` in `_ready()`. |
| `af2714b` | No initial handoff overlay at game start | Presentation | `active_player_changed` signal fired before `_connect_signals()` in `game_board._ready()`. Added manual initial call + deferred dial flow to handoff acceptance. |
| `0606e16` | Inverted mouse controls at 180° rotation | Presentation | Screen-to-world conversions in `BoardCamera` didn't account for camera rotation. Applied `.rotated(-rotation)` to all pan/zoom screen-space offsets. |
| `5db1b48` | Opponent command dial stacks viewable | Presentation | `ShipCardPanel._viewer_player` was `-1` (unset), disabling the access guard. Now set via `setup()` and updated on `active_player_changed`. |

**Requirements reinforced:** BP-001/002 (camera rotation), HO-001/003 (handoff overlay), UI-023 (opponent dial restriction), CP-001 (phase sequence)
**Tests delivered:** 1 new regression test (672 total, 43 scripts, all passing)

### Phase 4c: Ship Activation Trigger ✅
**Status:** Complete — committed `35f7e12`, bug fixes in `35f0f39`, `c666d52`, `36460b5`
**Goal:** Enable players to activate ships during the Ship Phase by dragging the topmost command dial to the ship token on the board. This is the minimal activation flow that enables the turn loop to reach round 2+ interactively, without implementing movement or attacks.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 4b (turn management, End Activation button), Phase 3 (ShipInstance, CommandDialStack)
**Duration estimate:** 1–2 sessions
**Completed:** 701 tests passing (44 scripts, 1358 asserts)

| Task | Layer | Requirements | Deliverables | Status |

| Full-scope skip: Attack + Maneuver steps | — | SP-013–015 | **Deferred to Phase 5/6.** Activation currently goes directly from Reveal Dial → End Activation. | ✅ |

> **Full-scope gaps (for seamless Phase 5/6 integration):**
>
> The following activation sub-steps are intentionally skipped in Phase 4c and must be added later:
>
> 1. **Keep-or-convert choice (SP-011):** After revealing the dial, the player should choose to keep it (spend during activation) or convert it to a command token. Phase 4c always keeps the dial. **→ Moved to Phase 4d** (drag-to-card = convert, drag-to-ship = keep).
> 2. **Attack step (SP-013, SP-014):** Up to 2 attacks from different hull zones. Deferred entirely to Phase 6.
> 3. **Execute Maneuver step (SP-015):** Mandatory movement using the maneuver tool. Deferred entirely to Phase 5.
> 4. **Navigate command resolution (CM-010–013):** Speed/yaw modification during movement. Deferred to Phase 5.
> 5. **Squadron command resolution (CM-020–022):** Activate squadrons at range after dial reveal. ✅ Implemented in Phase 9.5.
> 6. **Repair command resolution (CM-030–037):** Engineering points for shield/hull recovery. Deferred to Phase 9.
> 7. **Concentrate Fire (CM-040–042):** Extra die / reroll during attack. Deferred to Phase 6.
> 8. **CM-007 (unused dial discard):** If the dial is not spent during activation, it should be discarded. Phase 4c always spends/discards on End Activation. Full logic in Phase 5.
> 9. **Activation step gating:** "End Activation" should only be available after Attack + Maneuver are complete. Phase 4c allows immediate end. Phase 5 must add step-by-step gating.

**Requirements covered:** UI-024 (drag-and-drop), UI-025 (dial behind base), UI-026 (spent transition), SP-010 (activate), SP-011 (reveal top — partial), IN-001 (initiative stays with Rebel)
**Tests delivered:** 21 new (701 total, 44 scripts, all passing)

#### Post-Phase-4c Bug Fixes

Three fix commits addressed issues discovered during multi-round playtesting:

| Commit | Fix | Layer | Details |
|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| `35f0f39` | Composite dial graphic, spent dial gap, round-2 cleanup + picker context | Presentation | Revealed dial on board now uses a composite Node2D (background + icon overlay at 75%) instead of a single sprite. Spent dial in card panel displays below active stack with 12 px gap using `SIZE_SHRINK_CENTER`. Status Phase clears spent history (`clear_spent_history()`) so round-2 card panel starts fresh. Command dial picker shows existing stack commands for player context. |
| `c666d52` | Hide revealed dial from stack, center spent dial alignment | Presentation | Revealed dial no longer appears in the card panel dial stack (only visible on board token). Spent dial Control uses `SIZE_SHRINK_CENTER` to prevent VBoxContainer stretching. |
| `36460b5` | Initiative stays with first player, fix round-2 dial assignment | Core | Initiative no longer flips during Status Phase — per RRG "Initiative" p.8: "The first player retains initiative for the entire game." Rebel player (player 0) always has initiative (IN-001). `get_dials_needed()` changed from `get_dials_needed(current_round: int)` to parameterless — now returns `max(0, command_value - get_dial_count())`, making it state-aware instead of hardcoding round logic. Fixes Nebulon-B being skipped in round 2. |

---

### Phase 4d: Keep-or-Convert Dial Choice ✅
**Goal:** Extend the dial drag-and-drop activation to support both SP-011 paths: dragging the dial to the **ship token on the board** keeps it for its full command effect (existing behaviour), while dragging it to the **ship card panel entry** converts it to a matching command token. A help text guides the player during the drag.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 4c (dial drag-and-drop activation), Phase 4 (CommandTokenManager)
**Duration estimate:** 1 session

| Task | Layer | Requirements | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Drag help text overlay | Presentation | UI-027 | Show *"Drag to ship for full command effect · Drag to ship card for command token"* while dragging; disappears on drop/cancel |
| Drop target on ShipCardPanel entry | Presentation | UI-028, UI-024 | `ship_card_panel.gd` accepts dial drop on the owning ship's card entry |
| Convert dial to command token on card drop | Core/App | UI-028, SP-011, CM-004–006 | Call `CommandTokenManager.add_token()` with matching type; enforce duplicate/overflow rules (CM-004/CM-005) |
| Move dial to spent area on card drop | Presentation | UI-028, UI-020 | Call `CommandDialStack.spend_revealed()` immediately; update card panel display |
| Begin activation after card drop | Core/App | UI-028, SP-010 | Ship enters activated state (same as board drop), "End Activation" becomes available |
| No revealed dial on board for card drop | Presentation | UI-028 | Skip the composite dial sprite behind ship base — no board visual since dial was converted |
| Command token display update | Presentation | GC-018 | New token appears in the vertical token stack to the right of the ship card |

> **Rules Reference:** "Command Dials", p.3: "When a ship's command dial is revealed,
> the player can either resolve the command at the appropriate time during the
> ship's activation or spend the command dial to gain a command token of the
> same type." SP-011b implements the latter path.

**Requirements covered:** UI-027 (help text), UI-028 (drag-to-card converts), SP-011 (full keep-or-convert), CM-004–006 (token rules)
**Tests:** 15 (activate_ship_as_token domain tests, token overflow/duplicate rejection, activation ended after token convert, card panel hit detection, full cycle mix of board + card drops)

---

### Phase 4e: Command Token Overflow Discard ✅
**Goal:** When a dial-to-token conversion would exceed the ship's command value, temporarily add the token and prompt the player to click one of the surplus tokens to discard. For duplicates, auto-discard immediately and show a brief notification.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 4d (keep-or-convert), Phase 4 (CommandTokenManager)
**Duration estimate:** 1 session

| Task | Layer | Requirements | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `force_add_token()` in CommandTokenManager | Core | CM-004, CM-005 | Bypasses capacity/dup checks; returns `{overflow, duplicate}` dict |

| GameBoard discard flow wiring | Presentation | CM-004 | Delay End Activation button until discard resolved |
| Duplicate token notification | Presentation | CM-005 | Brief toast label ("Duplicate discarded") that auto-hides after 2s |
| Unit tests for `force_add_token` | Test | — | 6 tests: normal, overflow, duplicate, cmd-value-1, resolve scenarios |
| Integration tests for discard flow | Test | — | 4 tests: overflow signal, duplicate signal, manual discard resolve, no-overflow baseline |

> **Rules Reference:** "Command Tokens", p.4: "When a ship is assigned a command
> token, if it has more command tokens than its command value, it must immediately
> discard one of its command tokens." Also: "When a ship is assigned a command
> token, if it already has a copy of that command token, it must immediately
> discard that command token."

**Requirements covered:** CM-004 (overflow discard), CM-005 (duplicate auto-discard)
**Tests:** ~10 (6 unit + 4 integration)

### Phase 4f: Hover Tooltip Infrastructure ✅
**Goal:** Build a reusable, globally switchable tooltip system that displays contextual help text on hover (with configurable delay) and replaces all existing ad-hoc help labels (drag help, discard prompt, duplicate toast) with a single unified mechanism.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 4d (drag help label to migrate), Phase 4e (discard prompt + duplicate toast to migrate)
**Duration estimate:** 2 sessions
**Architecture:** arc42 § 8.8 · ADR-009 · Requirements: `docs/requirements/hover_tooltip_system.md`

| Task | Layer | Requirements | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Add `"tooltip"` section to `scale_config.json` | Data | TT-040, TT-042, TT-075 | New config block with delay, offset, max width, font, colours, toggle button size |

| Wire hover regions (ShipCardPanel: dial stack + card entry) | Presentation | TT-012, TT-080–086 | `register()` calls with context-sensitive callbacks: dial stack (reveal/drag/order), card entry (magnify). Two callbacks + two registrations per ship entry |
| Migrate drag help label → `show_text()` | Presentation | UI-027, TT-005, TT-053 | Remove `_create_drag_help_label()` / `_center_drag_help_label()` / `_drag_help_label` from `game_board.gd`; use `TooltipManager.show_text()` on drag start, `.hide()` on drop |
| Migrate discard prompt → `show_text()` | Presentation | TT-005, TT-053 | Remove discard prompt Label from `ship_card_panel.gd`; use `TooltipManager.show_text("Click a token to discard")` |
| Migrate duplicate toast → `show_text()` + auto-hide | Presentation | TT-005, TT-053 | Remove toast Label from `ship_card_panel.gd`; use `TooltipManager.show_text(text, Vector2.INF, 2.0)` |

| Register `TooltipManager` in `project.godot` | Config | TT-051 | Autoload entry |
| Run full test suite — verify 0 failures + expected script count | Test | — | Regression check |

> **Key design decisions:**
>
> - **Callback-based text** (Callable, not static string) — each region's tooltip
>   text is computed at show-time, reflecting current game state (TT-012).
> - **FORCED state** in the state machine — programmatic `show_text()` overrides
>   hover and ignores the toggle switch, because drag help and discard prompts
>   are essential gameplay instructions, not optional hints (TT-007, TT-073).
> - **Toggle button** in lower-right corner — players who know the game can
>   disable hover hints without losing essential instructions (TT-070–075).
> - **Layer 100 CanvasLayer** — tooltip always renders above all other UI (TT-050).
> - **Auto-deregister** via `tree_exiting` signal — prevents use-after-free on
>   scene transitions (TT-052).

**Requirements covered:** TT-001–007 (hover trigger + programmatic API), TT-010–013 (content), TT-020–022 (positioning), TT-030–035 (visual style), TT-040–042 (configuration), TT-050–053 (lifecycle + migration), TT-060–063 (testability), TT-070–075 (global toggle), TT-080–086 (contextual hover hints), UI-027 (drag help migration)
**Tests:** 17 (5 unit + 12 integration) — 759 total, 47 scripts, 1488 asserts

### Phase 4g: Fixed Round-1 Commands ✅
**Goal:** Allow the learning scenario to use pre-assigned command dials in round 1, skipping the command phase entirely. Configurable via `use_fixed_round1_commands` and `fixed_round1_commands` fields in the scenario JSON. When active, `LearningScenarioSetup` auto-assigns each ship's dial stack from the JSON data, and `GameManager` skips the command phase UI in round 1.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 4 (CommandDialStack, command phase flow), Phase 3 (LearningScenarioSetup, ShipInstance)
**Duration estimate:** 1 session
**Requirements:** CP-009, CP-010
**Completed:** 933 tests passing (54 scripts, 1776 asserts)

**Requirements covered:** CP-009 (fixed commands config + assignment), CP-010 (skip command phase in round 1)
**Tests:** 17 new (933 total, 54 scripts, 1776 asserts)

---

### Phase 5a: Maneuver Tool Visualization & Toolbar ✅
**Goal:** Standalone maneuver tool that can be displayed on the board, attached to a ship, with interactive joints. Plus a lower-right action toolbar that houses both the tooltip toggle and the new "Display Maneuver Tool" button.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 (ManeuverCalculator already has `compute_tool_joints()`, `YAW = 22.5°`), Phase 3 (ShipInstance/ShipToken), Phase 4f (tooltip toggle — relocated into toolbar)
**Requirements:** `docs/requirements/maneuver_tool.md` (MT-G-001–008, MT-U-001–006, MT-D-001–002, AC-01–16)

### Phase 5a+: Dynamic Alignment & Speed Simulation ✅
**Goal:** Auto-switch **both** root attachment and ghost alignment based on joint bending direction (tool follows the bend; ghost appears opposite). Add +/− speed simulation buttons on the end segment to preview different speeds without modifying ship state.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 5a (maneuver tool scene, tool state, ghost preview)
**Requirements:** `docs/requirements/maneuver_tool.md` §8–§11 (MT-A-001–004, MT-S-001–006, MT-D-003a, AC-17–25)

### Phase 5d-2: Targeting List — Squadron Sections & Hull Zone Detail ✅
**Goal:** Extend the targeting list with three enhancements: (1) Add friendly squadron sections showing outgoing targets (ships + squadrons at distance 1) and incoming threats (enemy ships' anti-squadron arcs + enemy squadrons at distance 1). (2) Show per-defending-hull-zone breakdown for ship → ship targets instead of collapsing to the single closest zone. (3) Update the UI modal to display squadron sections and hull zone detail lines.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 5d (Targeting List Tool), Phase 5d-fix (squadron armament)
**Duration estimate:** 1–2 sessions

**Tests:** 20 new tests (59 scripts, 1024 total, 1906 asserts)

---

### Phase 6a-3: Attack Simulator — Same-Ship Guard, Arc Validation & Range Line ✅
**Goal:** Prevent illegal target selections (same ship, not in arc) with tooltip feedback. Draw a range measurement line (closest-point-to-closest-point) colour-coded by range band alongside the existing LOS line. Add new `RangeFinder` endpoint functions that return both distance and the two world-space points used for measurement.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6a-2 (target selection, LOS line, overlay, panel)
**Duration estimate:** 1 session
**Requirements:** `docs/requirements/attack_simulator.md` (AS-TGT-030, AS-ARC-001–002, AS-RNG-010–014, AS-LOG-020, AC-AS-40–48)

---

### Phase 6a-4: Hull-Zone Edge Polyline Fix (HZ-EDGE-001) ✅
**Goal:** Fix incorrect hull-zone edge geometry. The previous implementation used rectangle corners for hull-zone edges, but firing arc boundary lines do not always intersect at the template corners. FRONT and REAR edges now use 3-segment polylines wrapping around the template corners, derived from arc boundary outer points and new `corner_*` JSON fields.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6a-3 (RangeFinder, arc validation, range measurement)
**Duration estimate:** 1 session

| # | Task | Layer | Req IDs | Deliverables | Status |
|---|------|-------|---------|--------------|--------|

---

### Phase 6b-1: Attack Execution — Target Selection & Visuals ✅
**Goal:** Add an "Execute Attack ►" button in the activation modal's Attack step. Pressing it closes the modal, shows the range overlay for the activated ship, and enters a target-selection flow that reuses the attack simulator infrastructure. Visual differences from the simulator: no arc lines, no range line — only LOS markers and LOS line. After target selection, the dice pool (by colour, filtered by range) is displayed. A "Done" button completes the attack step and re-opens the activation modal at the Maneuver step. Only the activated ship's hull zones can be the attacker; only enemy units can be targets.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6a-4 (attack sim overlay, panel, LOS, range, arc validation)

| # | Task | Layer | Requirements | Deliverables | Status |
|---|------|-------|-------------|--------------|--------|

**Tests:** 1074 (60 scripts, 1989 asserts) — 19 new tests

---

### Phase 6b-2: Attack Execution — Dice Rolling, Concentrate Fire & Two-Hull-Zone Sequencing ✅
**Goal:** After target selection (Phase 6b-1), the player can optionally spend a Concentrate Fire dial to add a die, roll the dice pool, optionally spend a CF token to reroll one die, then confirm. The attack sequence supports two sequential hull zone attacks with the first zone marked as spent. Damage resolution is deferred (dice are rolled but damage is not applied).
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6b-1 (target selection, LOS, dice count display, DicePool, Dice class)
**Duration estimate:** 1–2 sessions

#### Requirements

**Concentrate Fire Dial** (Rules Reference: "Concentrate Fire", p.3)

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-CF-001 | After target selected with dice count visible, if the ship's revealed command dial is Concentrate Fire (kept as dial, not converted to token), show prompt: "Spend CF dial for +1 die?" | Check `command_dial_stack.get_revealed_dial()` command type |
| AE-CF-002 | Show clickable colour buttons only for colours present in the attacking hull zone's battery armament (or anti-squadron armament when targeting a squadron) | e.g. CR90 FRONT: [+ Red] [+ Blue] — no Black button |
| AE-CF-003 | Pressing a colour button: adds 1 die of that colour to the pool, updates the dice count display, spends the dial via `CommandDialStack.spend_revealed()`, hides the dial sprite on the ship token | Irreversible action |
| AE-CF-004 | "Skip" button to decline the extra die — CF dial remains unspent for potential later use (e.g. second hull zone attack) | |
| AE-CF-005 | CF dial prompt appears BEFORE the "Roll Dice" button; rolling is blocked until the dial decision is resolved | |

**Dice Rolling** (Rules Reference: "Attack", Step 2, p.2)

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-DICE-001 | "Roll Dice" button appears after the CF dial decision (or immediately if no CF dial available) | |
| AE-DICE-002 | Rolling uses `Dice.roll_pool()` with the final pool (base armament ± CF extra die), converting DicePool string keys to DiceColor enums | |
| AE-DICE-003 | Rolled dice shown as die-face PNG images (~32×32 px) in a horizontal row inside the panel; PNGs from `Resources/Game_Components/dice/` | e.g. `die_red_hit.png`, `die_blue_accuracy.png` |
| AE-DICE-004 | "Roll Dice" button hidden after rolling; dice count label replaced by actual image results | |

**Concentrate Fire Token Reroll** (Rules Reference: "Concentrate Fire", p.3)

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-CF-010 | After rolling, if the ship holds a Concentrate Fire command token, show: "Spend CF token to reroll 1 die?" | Check `command_tokens.has_token(CONCENTRATE_FIRE)` |
| AE-CF-011 | Player clicks a die image to select it (yellow border highlight); then presses "Reroll" button | Only one die may be selected at a time |
| AE-CF-012 | Rerolled die replaces the selected die in the results display using its new face PNG | |
| AE-CF-013 | CF token spent via `CommandTokenManager.spend_token(CONCENTRATE_FIRE)` after reroll; reroll UI removed | Irreversible |
| AE-CF-014 | "Skip" button to decline the reroll — CF token remains unspent | |

**Confirm & Damage Skip**

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-CONF-001 | "Confirm" button appears below dice results (after optional reroll decision) | |
| AE-CONF-002 | Pressing Confirm ends the current hull zone's attack; damage resolution is skipped for now (deferred to Phase 6) | Placeholder: log dice results, no shield/hull changes |

**Two-Hull-Zone Sequencing** (Rules Reference: "Ship Activation", p.16 — "each of its hull zones can be used to perform one attack")

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-2HZ-001 | After first hull zone Confirm, return to hull zone selection for a second attack from a different hull zone | Reset target state, keep range overlay |
| AE-2HZ-002 | The first hull zone's LOS marker is overlaid with a translucent red dot (6 px diameter) indicating it has already fired | Drawn by AttackSimOverlay |
| AE-2HZ-003 | The first hull zone is blocked from re-selection; clicking it shows tooltip: "This hull zone has already attacked." | |
| AE-2HZ-004 | "Skip" button available during second hull zone selection to decline the second attack | |
| AE-2HZ-005 | After second Confirm (or Skip), complete the attack step → dismiss visuals → re-open activation modal with Attack step checkmarked | |

**Skip Logic**

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-SKIP-001 | "Skip Attack" button visible during hull zone selection to skip the current attack opportunity | |
| AE-SKIP-002 | Skipping first hull zone → transitions to second hull zone opportunity (no red dot, no zone blocked) | |
| AE-SKIP-003 | Skipping second hull zone → completes the attack step | |
| AE-SKIP-004 | Auto-skip entire attack when no hull zone has valid targets (enemy in arc + at range) | `_attack_exec_has_any_valid_target()` |
| AE-SKIP-005 | Auto-skip second attack when no remaining unfired hull zone has valid targets | Check in `_attack_exec_prepare_next_attack()` |
| AE-SKIP-006 | "Skip Attack" button shown immediately at hull zone selection phase (not just after target/dice phase) | Shown in `_on_attack_step_entered()` |
| AE-SKIP-007 | When no valid targets, Attack step is auto-checkmarked in the activation modal (no Execute Attack button appears) | `ActivationModal.set_attack_skippable()` + `_ship_has_any_attack_target()` |

#### Implementation Tasks

**Tests:** 60 scripts, 1105 tests, 2061 asserts (31 new tests)

---

### Phase 6b-3: Attack Execution — Anti-Squadron Multi-Target Sequencing ✅
**Goal:** After confirming an attack against a squadron, the ship can declare another enemy squadron as a defender from the same hull zone (Rules Reference: "Attack", Step 6). Each attacked squadron is marked with a translucent red dot. The loop repeats the full dice sequence (CF dial → Roll → Reroll → Confirm) per squadron until no more eligible targets remain or the player skips.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6b-2 (dice rolling, confirm, two-hull-zone sequencing)
**Duration estimate:** 0.5 session

#### Requirements

**Anti-Squadron Loop** (Rules Reference: "Attack", Step 6, p.2)

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-SQ-001 | Track squadrons already attacked during the current hull zone's anti-squadron loop in `_attack_exec_attacked_squads` | Reset on hull zone change or attack done |
| AE-SQ-002 | Block re-targeting an already-attacked squadron with tooltip: "{name} has already been attacked." | Guard in `_attack_sim_handle_target_squadron_click()` |
| AE-SQ-003 | After confirming attack vs squadron, check for remaining enemy squadrons in same arc AND at attack range (not beyond) that have not been attacked | `_attack_exec_has_more_squad_targets()` |
| AE-SQ-004 | If more targets exist, reset target/dice state, show prompt "Select next squadron in arc, or Skip." — hull zone stays locked, cannot be deselected | `_attack_exec_prepare_next_squadron()` |
| AE-SQ-005 | For each subsequent squadron target, repeat the full dice sequence: CF dial (if not yet spent) → Roll → CF token reroll (if token available) → Confirm | Each repetition is a new attack per rules ("Treat each repetition of steps 2 through 6 as a new attack for the purposes of resolving card effects.") |
| AE-SQ-006 | "Skip Attack" during the squadron loop ends the loop and moves to the next hull zone (or finishes if both HZs done) — does NOT end the entire attack step | |
| AE-SQ-007 | Each confirmed squadron attack draws a translucent red 6px dot on the squadron's base centre via `AttackSimOverlay.add_spent_zone_marker()` | Visual feedback for attacked squadrons |
| AE-SQ-008 | Hull zone locked during squadron loop: clicking attacker ship shows tooltip "Hull zone is locked during anti-squadron attacks." | Prevents deselection |
| AE-SQ-009 | When no more eligible squadron targets remain after confirm, record hull zone as fired and proceed to next hull zone selection (or finish) | Same as AE-2HZ-001 flow |

#### Implementation Tasks

### Phase 6c: Attack Steps 3–5 — Accuracy, Defense Tokens & Damage Resolution ✅
**Goal:** Complete the attack sequence by implementing Step 3 (accuracy spending to lock defender tokens), Step 4 (defense token spending: Scatter, Evade, Brace, Redirect, Contain), and Step 5 (damage resolution: shields → hull → damage cards → ship destruction).
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6b-3 (dice rolling, confirm, two-hull-zone sequencing, anti-squadron loop)
**Duration:** 1 session

#### Requirements

**Phase 6c-1: Accuracy Spending** (Rules Reference: "Attack", Step 3, "Accuracy", p.1)

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-ACC-001 | After dice confirmation, count accuracy icons in the pool via `Dice.count_accuracy()` | New static method on Dice |
| AE-ACC-002 | If ≥1 accuracy and defender has defense tokens, show accuracy section in AttackSimPanel with defender's token buttons | Budget = accuracy count |
| AE-ACC-003 | Player can toggle tokens on/off up to accuracy budget; toggled tokens are "locked" | Locked indices stored in panel |
| AE-ACC-004 | "Confirm Accuracy" button proceeds to defense step; locked token indices passed to game_board | Signal: `accuracy_confirmed` |
| AE-ACC-005 | If 0 accuracies or defender has no tokens, skip directly to defense step | Auto-skip with no UI |
| AE-ACC-006 | `Dice.has_any_critical()` — new static helper to check for CRITICAL or HIT_CRITICAL faces | Used later by damage resolution |

**Phase 6c-2: Defense Token Spending** (Rules Reference: "Defense Tokens", p.5; "Evade"/"Brace"/"Redirect"/"Scatter"/"Contain")

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-DEF-001 | Show defense section with defender's spendable tokens (READY or EXHAUSTED, not DISCARDED, not accuracy-locked) | Token buttons with exhaust/discard options |
| AE-DEF-002 | Speed 0 defenders cannot spend any defense tokens (Rules Reference: "Defense Tokens", bullet 4) | Auto-skip with log |
| AE-DEF-003 | Each token type can be spent at most once per attack | Disable button after spending |
| AE-DEF-003a | Defense token buttons toggle selection (highlight) instead of immediately spending; player clicks "Commit Defense" to apply | Two-phase: select → commit. Visual green highlight + ✓ on selected tokens. One-per-type enforced during selection. |
| AE-DEF-003b | Selected defense tokens can be deselected before committing | Click again to toggle off; restores original modulate |
| AE-DEF-003c | Commit processes selected tokens sequentially via queue; evade/redirect pause for sub-steps | `_defense_commit_queue`, `_process_next_defense_commit()` |
| AE-DEF-003d | "Done Redirecting" button allows early exit from redirect sub-step during commit queue | `redirect_done_pressed` signal, `_on_redirect_done_early()` |
| AE-DEF-004 | READY tokens can be exhausted; EXHAUSTED tokens must be discarded | Spend method determined by state |
| AE-DEF-005 | **Scatter** — cancels all dice, sets modified damage to 0, ends defense step immediately | Most impactful token |
| AE-DEF-006 | **Evade** — defender manually selects a die: at long range remove it, at medium/close reroll it (immediate apply on click) | `_attack_exec_start_evade()` + `_on_evade_die_selected()` |
| AE-DEF-007 | **Brace** — deferred to Step 5 (Resolve Damage): halve total damage (round up); show pending indicator during Step 4 | Flag `_attack_exec_brace_used`, applied in `_attack_exec_resolve_damage()` |
| AE-DEF-008 | **Redirect** — enter redirect sub-step: player clicks adjacent hull zones to move damage 1-at-a-time up to shield capacity | `_attack_exec_start_redirect()`, per-click allocation |
| AE-DEF-009 | **Contain** — prevent the first damage card from being dealt faceup (standard critical blocked) | Flag `_attack_exec_contain_used` |
| AE-DEF-010 | "Done" button ends defense step and proceeds to damage resolution | Signal: `defense_tokens_done` |
| AE-DEF-011 | Camera rotates to defender's player before defense step | `_camera.rotate_to_player()` |
| AE-DEF-012 | Real-time damage display updated after each token spend | `update_defense_damage()` on panel |

**Phase 6c-3: Damage Resolution** (Rules Reference: "Attack", Step 5; "Damage", p.5–6)

| ID | Requirement | Notes |
|----|------------|-------|
| AE-DMG-001 | Calculate total damage from modified dice pool via `Dice.calculate_damage()` | After all defense modifications |
| AE-DMG-002 | For ship targets: shields in attacked zone absorb damage first via `reduce_shields()` | Emit `ship_shields_changed` |
| AE-DMG-003 | Remaining damage dealt as facedown damage cards from DamageDeck | One card per damage point |
| AE-DMG-004 | Standard critical effect: if pool has critical icon AND Contain not used, first card is faceup | `has_any_critical()` check |
| AE-DMG-005 | Ship destroyed when total damage ≥ hull value | `is_destroyed()` check |
| AE-DMG-006 | Destroyed ship hidden from board, `ship_destroyed` signal emitted | Visual removal |

### Post-Phase-5d LOS Bug Fix ✅

**Bug:** `_los_blocked_by_other_hull_zone()` in `LineOfSightChecker` assigned each rectangle edge entirely to one hull zone (e.g. the full RIGHT edge → RIGHT zone). For ships whose base is taller than wide (medium/large), the LEFT and RIGHT edges span FRONT, LEFT/RIGHT, and REAR hull zones. LOS entering the RIGHT edge in the REAR third was incorrectly classified as entering the RIGHT zone, causing false "LOS Blocked" results (e.g. Nebulon-B RIGHT arc → VSD REAR).

**Fix:** After finding the first perimeter intersection, convert the entry point to the defender's local space and classify the hull zone using the 1/3-length division rule (same as `ShipToken.get_hull_zone_at()`). Added `_classify_local_point()` helper. Removed stale `TODO(HZ-EDGE-001)`.

| Task | File | Details | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| Point-based hull zone classification at entry point | `src/core/line_of_sight_checker.gd` | Replace edge-based zone with `_classify_local_point()` | ✅ |
| New `_classify_local_point()` static helper | `src/core/line_of_sight_checker.gd` | 1/3-length division: FRONT/REAR by y, LEFT/RIGHT by x sign | ✅ |
| Update LOS + targeting tests for corrected behaviour | `tests/unit/test_line_of_sight_checker.gd`, `tests/unit/test_targeting_list_builder.gd` | 7 new tests, 3 updated assertions | ✅ |

**Tests:** 65 scripts, 1223 tests, 2207 asserts — 1222 passing, 1 pre-existing Nebulon-B placement failure

---

### Post-Phase-5d LOS Bug Fix v2 — Arc-Boundary Intersection ✅

**Bug:** The 1/3-length-division heuristic from the previous LOS fix still produced false "LOS Blocked" results (e.g. Nebulon-B FRONT arc → VSD LEFT arc). The heuristic splits the ship rectangle into thirds by length, but hull zones are actually separated by diagonal arc boundary lines (inner_point → outer_point) defined in each ship's JSON. The 1/3 rule does not match these real boundaries.

**Fix:** Check whether the LOS segment crosses any of the 4 arc boundary lines (front_left, front_right, rear_left, rear_right). If the LOS line crosses any boundary, it enters through a different hull zone → blocked. The rectangle+classify approach is kept as a fallback when arc data is unavailable.

| Task | File | Details | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| Primary arc-boundary intersection check | `src/core/line_of_sight_checker.gd` | `_los_blocked_by_arc_boundaries()`, `_has_arc_boundary_keys()`, `_ARC_BOUNDARY_PAIRS` const | ✅ |
| `get_blocking_boundary_info()` debug helper | `src/core/line_of_sight_checker.gd` | Returns boundary name, inner/outer points, intersection point for logging | ✅ |
| Fallback preserved as `_los_blocked_by_rect_classify()` | `src/core/line_of_sight_checker.gd` | Original 1/3-length approach used when no arc data | ✅ |
| Pass arc boundary data from all call sites | `game_board.gd`, `targeting_list_builder.gd` | `def_arc_pts` parameter added to `trace_los_ship_to_ship()`, `trace_los_squad_to_ship()`, `is_range_path_blocked()` | ✅ |

**Tests:** 65 scripts, 1240 tests, 2226 asserts — 1239 passing, 1 pre-existing Nebulon-B placement failure

### Post-Phase-6c Bug Fix — Hull Display ✅

**Problem:** `ShipInstance.current_hull` was set once at creation and never decremented
when damage cards were dealt. The ship token always showed the max hull value regardless
of damage taken. The `ship_hull_changed` signal emitted the correct computed value, but
the display in `ship_token.gd` read the stale `current_hull` field instead.

**Fix (Option A — computed display):** Added `ShipInstance.get_remaining_hull()` which
returns `ship_data.hull - get_total_damage()`. Updated `ship_token.gd` to call this
instead of reading `current_hull`. No dual bookkeeping — the damage card arrays remain
the single source of truth.

| Deliverable | File | Details | Status |
|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| `get_remaining_hull()` method | `src/core/ship_instance.gd` | Returns `ship_data.hull - get_total_damage()` | ✅ |
| Hull label uses computed value | `src/scenes/tokens/ship_token.gd` | `_on_label_layer_draw()` calls `get_remaining_hull()` | ✅ |
| Unit tests (4 new) | `tests/unit/test_ship_instance.gd` | No damage, facedown, mixed, at destruction | ✅ |

**Tests:** 65 scripts, 1244 tests, 2231 asserts — 1243 passing, 1 pre-existing Nebulon-B placement failure

---

### Post-Phase-6c Bug Fix — Critical Icons vs Squadrons ✅

**Problem:** `Dice.calculate_damage()` always counted CRITICAL faces as 1 damage and
HIT_CRITICAL faces as 2 damage, regardless of the defender type. Per rules (RRG "Dice
Icons", p.5): "**Critical:** If the attacker and defender are ships, this icon adds one
damage to the damage total." Critical icons should deal **zero** damage against
squadrons; HIT_CRITICAL should count only the hit portion (1 damage).

**Fix:** Added `Dice.calculate_damage_vs_squadron()` and
`Dice.get_face_damage_vs_squadron()` which exclude the critical damage component. Added
`_calc_attack_damage()` helper in `game_board.gd` that dispatches to the correct method
based on whether the defender is a squadron (`_attack_sim_def_squad != null`). Updated
all 5 damage calculation call sites in the attack flow.

| Deliverable | File | Details | Status |
|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| `get_face_damage_vs_squadron()` | `src/core/dice.gd` | CRITICAL → 0, HIT_CRITICAL → 1 | ✅ |
| `calculate_damage_vs_squadron()` | `src/core/dice.gd` | Sums hit-only damage | ✅ |
| `_calc_attack_damage()` helper | `src/scenes/game_board/attack_executor.gd` | Dispatches by defender type | ✅ |
| All call sites updated | `src/scenes/game_board/attack_executor.gd` | 5 call sites use `_calc_attack_damage()` | ✅ |
| Unit tests (6 new) | `tests/unit/test_dice.gd` | Crit ignored, hit-crit → 1, mixed pool, etc. | ✅ |

**Tests:** 65 scripts, 1250 tests, 2237 asserts — 1249 passing, 1 pre-existing Nebulon-B placement failure

### AttackExecutor Extraction Refactoring ✅

**Motivation:** `game_board.gd` had grown to 4057 lines with ~60 attack-related
functions. Before implementing Phase 7 (Squadron Phase), the attack subsystem was
extracted into a dedicated `AttackExecutor` node to improve maintainability.

**What changed:** ~2000 lines of attack simulator and attack execution code moved
from `game_board.gd` to a new `attack_executor.gd`. `GameBoard` creates the
executor as a child node and delegates via a 13-method + 3-signal interface. No
game logic was altered — pure structural refactoring.

| Deliverable | File | Details | Status |
|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| New `AttackExecutor` class (~2100 lines) | `src/scenes/game_board/attack_executor.gd` | All attack simulator + execution logic, extends Node | ✅ |
| `GameBoard` delegation wiring | `src/scenes/game_board/game_board.gd` | Reduced from 4057 → ~1890 lines, delegates via `_attack_executor` | ✅ |
| Architecture docs updated | `docs/arc42/05_building_block_view.md` | AttackExecutor added to component table | ✅ |
| Runtime view updated | `docs/arc42/06_runtime_view.md` | Attack resolution sequence diagrams filled in | ✅ |
| Manual test plan updated | `docs/test_plan_manual.md` | MT-AE.1–MT-AE.11 refactoring verification tests | ✅ |

**Interface:** `initialize()`, `set_damage_deck()`, `on_simulator_requested()`,
`start_ship_attack()`, `handle_ship_click()`, `handle_squadron_click()`,
`handle_escape()`, `dismiss()`, `is_active()`, `is_selecting()`,
`is_target_selecting()`, `is_in_exec_mode()`, `has_any_attack_target()`

**Signals:** `attack_exec_completed`, `attack_exec_cancelled`, `dismiss_other_tools_requested`

**Tests:** 65 scripts, 1250 tests, 2237 asserts — 1249 passing, 1 pre-existing Nebulon-B placement failure (unchanged)

---

### Phase 7: Squadron Phase ✅ — Effect/Hook pipeline, engagement, movement validation, keyword effects, interactive squadron activation.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 (geometry), Phase 3 (SquadronInstance), Phase 6 (attack pipeline for squadron attacks)
**Duration estimate:** 2–3 sessions

> **Placeholder replaced:** `_begin_squadron_phase()` previously auto-marked all
> squadrons as activated and immediately advanced to the Status Phase. Phase 7
> replaces this with an interactive alternating activation system, an Effect/Hook
> pipeline for rule-modifying effects, engagement calculations, and movement
> validation.

**Architecture:** Effect/Hook Pipeline (see `docs/arc42/08_crosscutting_concepts.md`)
- `GameEffect` base class → `EffectContext` mutable data bag → `EffectRegistry` central resolver
- Hook points: `ATTACK_CALC_DAMAGE`, `ATTACK_MODIFY_DICE_ATTACKER`, `SQUADRON_MUST_ATTACK_ENGAGED`
- Effects registered at game start via `EffectFactory.register_squadron_keywords()`
- Resolved in player-priority order (initiative player first)

- Reused SquadronActivationModal by generalizing the Rogue "move AND attack" flow into `_allow_move_and_attack`
- SquadronCommandResolver follows the RepairResolver factory pattern: `create()` → budget queries → `use_activation()` → `finalize()`
- Range check uses edge-to-edge approximation (same as existing `_squadron_has_valid_targets()`)
- Resolver calls `finalize()` (spending dial/token) from the modal before emitting `command_done`

**Tests:** 17 new tests (85 scripts, 1589 total, 1588 passing)

### Phase 10a: Immediate Damage Card Fixes + Opponent Choice UI ✅
**Goal:** Fix the 3 damage cards with incorrect effects (known defects from Phase 9d), and build a generic choice modal so the opponent/owner can make decisions instead of the current auto-pick-first-option hack.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 9 (ImmediateEffectResolver, DamageCard, DamageDeck)
**Duration estimate:** 1 session
**Requirements:** DM-010–015, Card texts for Injured Crew / Comm Noise

| # | Task | Layer | Req IDs | Deliverables | Status |
|---|------|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Fix Shield Failure (multi-zone, −1 each) | Core | DM-010–015 | Rewrite `_resolve_shield_failure()`: accept `{"zones": Array[String]}` (up to 2 distinct zones), each loses 1 shield. Rewrite `_get_shield_failure_choices()` to return multi-select descriptor. | ✅ |
| 2 | Fix Injured Crew (owner discards defense token) | Core | Card text | Rewrite `_resolve_injured_crew()`: ship's **owner** chooses and discards 1 defense token (ready or exhausted). Remove exhaust alternative. `chooser = "owner"`. | ✅ |
| 3 | Fix Comm Noise (reduce speed OR change top dial) | Core | Card text | Rewrite `_resolve_comm_noise()`: opponent picks (a) reduce speed by 1, or (b) choose a new command for top dial. Add `CommandDialStack.replace_top_command()`. | ✅ |
| 4 | Update `get_required_choice()` return format | Core | — | Add `"chooser": "opponent"/"owner"`, `"multi_select": bool`, `"max_selections": int`, `"card_title": String`, `"effect_text": String` to returned Dictionary. | ✅ |
| 5 | OpponentChoiceModal — generic choice UI | Presentation | DM-011 | New `src/ui/opponent_choice_modal.gd`: title, effect text, radio/checkbox options, Confirm button. §10 anchor reset. Emits `choice_confirmed(selection: Dictionary)`. | ✅ |
| 6 | Wire modal into AttackExecutor | Presentation | DM-011 | Replace auto-pick in `_resolve_immediate_card_effect()`. Show handoff banner for opponent choices (Shield Failure, Comm Noise); show modal directly for owner choices (Injured Crew). Await `choice_confirmed`. | ✅ |
| 7 | Unit tests — fixed effects | Test | — | Shield Failure multi-zone (0/1/2 zones, −1 each, duplicate rejected). Injured Crew discard-only. Comm Noise speed-reduce + dial-change. ~15 new/updated tests. | ✅ |

**Tests:** 1636 total (87 scripts, 2886 asserts) — +8 new tests for fixed effects

---

### Phase 10b: UI Polish (Card Detail View, Activation Sidebar, Movement Preview) ✅
**Goal:** Add card detail overlay, turn order sidebar, and movement preview polish.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 10a, all prior phases
**Duration estimate:** 1 session

| # | Task | Layer | Req IDs | Deliverables | Status |
|---|------|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 8 | Card detail view overlay | Presentation | UI-002 | New `src/ui/card_detail_overlay.gd`: full-screen semi-transparent overlay + large card image centred. Right-click on ship card panel entry → show artwork from `Resources/Game_Components/`. Click anywhere or Escape to dismiss. | ✅ |
| 9 | Turn order / activation sidebar | Presentation | UI-014 | New `src/ui/activation_sidebar.gd`: slide-in panel on lower-left edge (20 px peek, click to expand/collapse). Ships + squadrons grouped by faction with faction colours (Rebel orange, Imperial green). Activated units grey, destroyed units red. Currently-activating unit shown in **bold**. Initiative ★ marker. Updates via EventBus signals. | ✅ |
| 10 | Movement preview polish | Presentation | UI-010 | Ghost ship at static 0.35 alpha (pulse animation evaluated and removed — visual noise). `set_collision_preview()` API + "BLOCKED" label (red) for future wiring. | ✅ |

**Tests:** 1636 (87 scripts, 2886 asserts) — presentation-only changes, no new unit tests needed

---

### Phase 10c: Network Foundation ⏳ (deferred — prerequisites in Phase G)
**Goal:** Lay network multiplayer groundwork.
**Prerequisites:** All prior phases + Refactoring Phase G (command pattern)
**Duration estimate:** 2–3 sessions
**Note:** Phase G provides the command pattern and deterministic RNG that
this phase depends on. G5, G1, G3, and G2 Tier 1 are complete.

| # | Task | Layer | Req IDs | Deliverables | Status |
|---|------|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 11 | Network message protocol | Application | NW-001–003 | Message type definitions for all sync points | ⏳ |
| 12 | Server-side RNG | Core | NW-004 | Dice roll authority on server | ⏳ |
| 13 | State snapshot & reconnection | Application | NW-001, NW-006 | Full GameState serialization for all state added in Phases 4–9 | ⏳ |
| 14 | Secret information hiding | Application | NW-005 | Command dials only sent to owner | ⏳ |
| 15 | Turn timer (optional) | Application | NW-008 | Configurable per-player timer | ⏳ |

**Tests:** ~20 (serialization roundtrip, message validation)

---

### Phase 11: Splash Screen & Main Menu ✅
**Goal:** Add splash screen with background art and a main-menu modal that launches the Learning Scenario.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 10b (all gameplay phases complete)
**Duration estimate:** < 1 session

| # | Task | Layer | Req IDs | Deliverables | Status |
|---|------|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Splash background & title text | Presentation | UI-029 | `main_menu.tscn` / `main_menu.gd` rewritten: `splash.jpg` full-viewport background, "ARMADA" + "digital" two-line title centred in top 1/3 | ✅ |
| 2 | Menu modal with 2-second reveal | Presentation | UI-030 | Timer-based reveal; any click/key skips to instant show. PanelContainer with standard modal style (§1). 4 buttons: New Game, Load Game, Learning Scenario, Quit. | ✅ |
| 3 | Button wiring | Presentation | UI-031–033 | Learning Scenario → `change_scene_to_file(game_board.tscn)`. New Game / Load Game → "Coming Soon" toast. Quit → `get_tree().quit()`. | ✅ |
| 4 | In-game quit confirmation | Presentation | UI-034 | New `src/ui/quit_confirmation_modal.gd`: centred modal with "Quit game and exit to main menu?" + Yes/No. Wired into `game_board.gd` `_unhandled_input` as last ESC fallback. Yes → transition to main menu; No/Escape → dismiss and resume. | ✅ |

**Tests:** 1636 (87 scripts, 2886 asserts) — presentation-only; no new unit tests. Manual test entries in `test_plan_manual.md`.

---

### Phase 12: Sound & Music ✅
**Goal:** Add SFX for all button interactions + dice rolls + movement, and dynamic background music with crossfade, shuffled in-game playlist (12 tracks), destruction overrides, and victory themes.
**Prerequisites:** Phase 11 (main menu), Phase 8 (scoring/victory)
**Duration estimate:** 1 session

| # | Task | Layer | Req IDs | Deliverables | Status |
|---|------|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Sound config JSON | Data | SFX-010, MUS-009, MUS-010 | `Resources/Sound/sound_config.json`: per-clip volumes, rhythm arrays, fade/override durations | ✅ |
| 2 | SfxManager autoload | Application | SFX-001–010 | `src/autoload/sfx_manager.gd`: pool of 8 AudioStreamPlayers, `play_sfx()`, `play_rhythmic()`, auto-wired squadron movement SFX via EventBus | ✅ |
| 3 | MusicManager autoload | Application | MUS-001–010 | `src/autoload/music_manager.gd`: dual-player crossfade, shuffled in-game playlist (12 tracks, auto-advance on finish), destruction override timer, victory music via EventBus | ✅ |
| 4 | Menu SFX + music | Presentation | SFX-001, MUS-004 | `main_menu.gd`: `droid_sound` on all buttons, `rebel_theme` on load | ✅ |
| 5 | Confirm/skip SFX wiring | Presentation | SFX-002, SFX-003 | Added `SfxManager.play_sfx()` calls to ~15 UI files: quit modal, activation modal, squadron modal, attack sim panel, repair panel, command dial picker, handoff overlay, etc. | ✅ |
| 6 | Dice roll SFX | Presentation | SFX-004–006 | `attack_executor.gd._play_dice_roll_sfx()`: turbolasers for ships, rhythmic burst for squadrons (faction-dependent) | ✅ |
| 7 | Movement SFX | Presentation | SFX-007–009 | Ship: `star_destroyer_flyby` via execute_maneuver_button. Squadron: faction-specific flyby via `SfxManager._on_squadron_moved()` | ✅ |
| 8 | Skills documentation | Docs | — | `.skills/sound_and_music.md`: config schema, how-to guides, SFX categories, crossfade pattern | ✅ |

**Files created:** `Resources/Sound/sound_config.json`, `src/autoload/sfx_manager.gd`, `src/autoload/music_manager.gd`, `.skills/sound_and_music.md`
**Files modified:** `project.godot` (2 autoloads), `main_menu.gd`, `quit_confirmation_modal.gd`, `execute_maneuver_button.gd`, `end_activation_button.gd`, `handoff_overlay.gd`, `damage_summary_overlay.gd`, `victory_screen.gd`, `show_activation_button.gd`, `show_squadron_modal_button.gd`, `command_dial_picker.gd`, `repair_panel.gd`, `opponent_choice_modal.gd`, `activation_modal.gd`, `squadron_activation_modal.gd`, `attack_sim_panel.gd`, `displacement_modal.gd`, `attack_executor.gd`

---

### Post-Phase-12 Bug Fix — Ship Destruction Scoring ✅

**Bug:** Destroying a ship (e.g. Nebulon-B) did not mark it as destroyed and did not
award victory points. Root cause: `GameManager._on_ship_destroyed()` called
`clear_all_damage_cards()` which zeroed `get_total_damage()`, making `is_destroyed()`
return false before scoring ran.

**Fix:** Added a permanent `_destroyed` bool flag to `ShipInstance` and
`SquadronInstance` with `mark_destroyed()` method. Called at all 3 destruction sites
(ship damage resolution, squadron damage resolution, critical hit destruction) before
emitting signals. `is_destroyed()` now returns `_destroyed OR damage >= hull`.

| Deliverable | File | Details | Status |
|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| `_destroyed` flag + `mark_destroyed()` | `src/core/ship_instance.gd` | Permanent flag survives `clear_all_damage_cards()` | ✅ |
| `_destroyed` flag + `mark_destroyed()` | `src/core/squadron_instance.gd` | Same pattern for squadrons | ✅ |
| Call `mark_destroyed()` at all 3 sites | `game_board.gd`, `attack_executor.gd` | Before `ship_destroyed` / `squadron_destroyed` emit | ✅ |
| `is_destroyed()` null-safe guards | `ship_instance.gd`, `squadron_instance.gd` | Handle nil `ship_data` / `squadron_data` in tests | ✅ |

**Tests:** 87 scripts, 1641 tests — 1640 passing, 1 pre-existing Nebulon-B placement failure

---

### Post-Phase-12 Feature — Ghost Destroyed Ships & Squadrons ✅

**Rules basis:** RRG p.7 — "When a ship is destroyed, remove it from the play area …
Discard its damage cards … return its tokens and dials to the supply. All ship and
upgrade cards belonging to destroyed ships are inactive."

**What changed:** Destroyed ships and squadrons are now visually ghosted (dimmed) in the
Ship Card Panel and Activation Sidebar, and skipped by all phase-transition logic. This
prevents destroyed units from appearing in dial assignment, activation selection, or
status phase cleanup.

| Deliverable | File | Details | Status |
|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| Ghost ship card panel entry | `src/ui/ship_card_panel.gd` | `_on_ship_destroyed()` → `_ghost_entry()`: 35% alpha, MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE, red "DESTROYED" label, idempotent | ✅ |
| `_is_ship_phase_eligible()` rejects destroyed | `src/ui/ship_card_panel.gd` | Early return false if `instance.is_destroyed()` | ✅ |
| Activation sidebar dimming | `src/ui/activation_sidebar.gd` | `_update_entry()` sets `lbl.modulate.a = 0.5` for destroyed entries | ✅ |
| Skip destroyed in activation checks | `src/autoload/game_manager.gd` | `_has_unactivated_ships()` and `_has_unactivated_squadrons()` skip destroyed | ✅ |
| Skip destroyed in dial auto-check | `src/autoload/game_manager.gd` | `_on_command_picker_confirmed()` loop skips destroyed | ✅ |
| Skip destroyed in status phase | `src/autoload/game_manager.gd` | `_perform_status_phase_cleanup()` skips destroyed ships/squadrons | ✅ |
| Skip destroyed in dial assignment queue | `src/scenes/game_board/game_board.gd` | `_ships_needing_dials` builder skips destroyed ships | ✅ |
| Unit tests (4 new) | `tests/unit/test_ship_card_panel.gd` | Ghost dims, blocks mouse, idempotent, eligible-rejected | ✅ |

**Tests:** 87 scripts, 1645 tests, 2895 asserts — 1644 passing, 1 pre-existing Nebulon-B placement failure

### Post-Phase-12 Feature — Audio Controls in ActionToolbar ✅

**Goal:** Give the player in-game controls for music playback — play/pause toggle,
next-track skip, and volume ±10 % buttons — without leaving the game board.

**Prerequisites:** Phase 12 (MusicManager exists), ActionToolbar (Phase 5c/5d)

| # | Task | Layer | Req IDs | Deliverables | Status |
|---|------|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | MusicManager public API | Application | MUS-011–013 | `toggle_pause()`, `is_paused()`, `skip_to_next()`, `get_volume_percent()`, `set_volume_percent()`, `_volume_multiplier` state | ✅ |

---

### Refactoring Phase A — Oversized-Function Extraction ✅

**Goal:** Split every function exceeding 30 lines into focused helpers
(≤ 30 body lines each). Pure structural refactoring — no game-logic changes.
See `docs/refactoring_plan.md` and `docs/refactoring_test_strategy.md`.

| # | Task | Target File | Deliverables | Status |

**Bug fixes included in A1-02 commit:**
- fix(squadron): guard modal re-open with phase check — prevents race condition where `EventBus.squadron_activation_ended` triggers synchronous phase transition before counter check, re-opening modal into the next round
- fix(status): emit `ship_defense_token_changed` after readying — UI now visually refreshes exhausted → ready tokens during Status Phase

**Tests:** 87 scripts, 1648 tests, 1647 passing, 1 pre-existing failure (Nebulon-B placement)

---

### Refactoring Phase D — UI Builder Cleanup ✅

**Goal:** Standardise UI builder methods and extract common styling into
a shared utility. Pure structural refactoring — no game-logic changes.
See `docs/refactoring_plan.md` Phase D.

#### D1: Section Builder Return Pattern ✅ `c35653b`

Converted all void `_build_*()` section methods across 13 UI files to
return their root container instead of imperatively calling `add_child()`
internally. Callers now do `parent.add_child(_build_section())`.

**Files changed:** 13 UI files, 63 methods converted.
**Tests:** 88 scripts, 1669 tests, 2932 asserts — all passing.

#### D2: UIStyleHelper Utility ✅ `a7ff225`

Created `src/utils/ui_style_helper.gd` — centralises repeated style
constants and factory methods:

| Extraction | Files Affected | Lines Saved |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| `create_modal_panel_style()` — canonical StyleBoxFlat | 10 modal panels | ~70 |
| `create_dismiss_hint()` — centered hint label | 3 files | ~15 |
| Colour constants (`GOLD_TITLE`, `DIMMED_HINT`, etc.) | — | definition site |
| Font-size tiers (`FONT_TITLE`, `FONT_BODY`, etc.) | — | definition site |
| `create_title_label()` / `create_section_label()` | — | factory methods |

**Files changed:** 10 UI files (panel style), 3 UI files (dismiss hints).
**New file:** `src/utils/ui_style_helper.gd` (30 tests).
**Tests:** 89 scripts, 1699 tests, 2966 asserts — all passing.

#### D3: Split ShipCardPanel ✅

Extracted construction and populate logic from `ship_card_panel.gd`
(1 438 → 877 lines) into two focused helpers:

| New file | Type | Lines | Responsibility |
|----------|------|-------|---------------|
| `ship_card_entry_builder.gd` | RefCounted | 460 | Build & populate entry rows (tokens, dials, cmd tokens) |
| `damage_card_display.gd` | RefCounted | 196 | Damage card column (faceup thumbnails + facedown badge) |

`ShipCardPanel` is now a layout coordinator that delegates all building
and populating to the two helpers. Shared `_tex_cache` is injected via
constructor. Dead constants (`TOKEN_FILENAMES`, `CMD_ICON_FILENAMES`,
`CMD_DIAL_HIDDEN_FILE`, `DAMAGE_CARD_HEIGHT_PX`), dead signal
(`damage_detail_requested`), and all superseded local methods removed.

**Tests:** 89 scripts, 1699 tests, 2966 asserts — all passing.

---

### Refactoring Phase E — Serialization & EventBus Cleanup ✅

**Goal:** Add `serialize()`/`deserialize()` to all core data classes,
extend `PlayerState` and `GameState` to include ships/squadrons/damage
deck, group EventBus signals with `#region` blocks, and create a
`SaveGameManager` autoload for JSON-based save/load.

| # | Task | Target File(s) | Deliverables | Status |
|---|------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| E3 | DamageCard + DamageDeck serialize | `damage_card.gd`, `damage_deck.gd` | `serialize()` / `deserialize()` on both classes; 13 tests | ✅ |
| E1 | ShipInstance serialize | `ship_instance.gd` | `serialize()` / `deserialize()` (delegates to sub-components); 9 tests | ✅ |
| E2 | SquadronInstance serialize | `squadron_instance.gd` | `serialize()` / `deserialize()`; 4 tests | ✅ |
| E4 | ShipActivationState serialize | `ship_activation_state.gd` | `serialize()` / `deserialize()`; 6 tests | ✅ |
| E6 | EventBus region grouping | `event_bus.gd` | 12 `#region`/`#endregion` blocks replacing `# ---` separators | ✅ |
| E5 | SaveGameManager autoload | `save_game_manager.gd` | `save_game()`, `load_game()`, `list_saves()`, `delete_save()`; registered in `project.godot`; 7 tests | ✅ |
| — | PlayerState ships/squads | `player_state.gd` | `serialize()` now includes ships & squadrons arrays | ✅ |
| — | GameState damage_deck | `game_state.gd` | `serialize()`/`deserialize()` now includes damage deck | ✅ |
| — | Doc comment fix | `damage_card_effect.gd`, `game_board.gd` | "obstacle" → "ship or obstacle" in Damaged Controls comments | ✅ |

**Tests:** 90 scripts, 1737 tests, 3083 asserts — all passing.

---

### Refactoring Phase F — Extract Backbone & ActivationContext (partial) ✅

**Goal:** Reduce `game_board.gd` by extracting shared activation state
into a lightweight RefCounted and all UI panel lifecycle into a dedicated
manager. See `docs/refactoring_plan.md` Phase F.

#### F1: ActivationContext ✅ `ad61b51`

Created `src/core/activation_context.gd` (60 lines, RefCounted) to hold
shared activation state previously scattered across `game_board.gd`:

- Properties: `activating_ship_token`, `ship_activation_state`,
  `last_maneuver_overlapped`
- Methods: `set_active(token, state)`, `clear()`, `is_active()`
- Signal: `activation_changed`
- Injected into ManeuverToolController, DisplacementController,
  SquadronPhaseController, AttackExecutor
- 101 references in `game_board.gd` replaced
- Debug save/load keybinds (F5/F8) added in same commit

**New file:** `src/core/activation_context.gd` (9 tests)
**Tests:** 91 scripts, 1746 tests, 3097 asserts — all passing.

#### F2: SquadronPhaseController ✅ (completed in C7)

Already extracted during Phase C7.

#### F3: UIPanelManager ✅ `8334d06`

Created `src/scenes/game_board/ui_panel_manager.gd` (435 lines) owning
all UI panel creation, positioning, resizing, and isolated callbacks:

- 15 public panel properties moved from `game_board.gd`
- All `_create_*` panel functions (card panels, overlays, modals,
  sidebars, toolbars, banners, HUD labels)
- Resize infrastructure: `_resizable_widgets`, `register_resizable()`,
  `on_viewport_resized()`
- Isolated callbacks: card detail, damage overview/summary, quit confirm,
  victory screen, phase HUD update, score changes
- `PHASE_NAMES` constant
- `game_board.gd` reduced from 2 789 → 2 207 lines (−582)

**New file:** `src/scenes/game_board/ui_panel_manager.gd` (8 tests)
**Tests:** 92 scripts, 1754 tests, 3113 asserts — all passing.

#### F4: AttackUIManager — DEFERRED

Analysis showed extraction is impractical at planned scope:
`_attack_sim_panel` has 159 references across ~80 functions. Only ~15
functions (~290 lines) are purely UI — the rest interleave panel updates
with state-machine transitions. Deferred to future incremental work.

#### F4a: AttackTargetResolver + CombatParticipants ✅

Extracted all pure-geometry target queries from `attack_executor.gd`
into two new RefCounted classes:

- **`src/core/combat_participants.gd`** (~130 lines) — Lightweight
  immutable-by-convention data class bundling attacker/defender identity
  (ship/zone/squadron × both sides), with `create()` and
  `create_attacker_only()` factories and convenience queries.
- **`src/core/attack_target_resolver.gd`** (~505 lines) — Pure-geometry
  resolver receiving `Callable` injections for ship/squadron/obstruction
  tokens. Public API: `get_ship_edge()`, `is_ship_target_in_arc()`,
  `is_squadron_target_in_arc()`, `compute_los()`, `compute_range()`,
  `is_squadron_at_range()`, `zone_has_targets()`,
  `has_any_attack_target()`, `has_any_valid_target()`,
  `has_more_squad_targets()`.
- AE wiring: 9 delegation replacements + 14 extracted functions removed.
  `_build_obstruction_bodies` stays in AE (scene-tree access), passed
  as Callable to the resolver.
- `attack_executor.gd` reduced from ~3 285 → 2 914 lines (−371).

**New files:** `combat_participants.gd` (28 tests), `attack_target_resolver.gd` (~30 tests)

#### F4b: AttackDiceResolver ✅

Extracted all pure dice/armament computation from `attack_executor.gd`
into a new RefCounted class:

- **`src/core/attack_dice_resolver.gd`** (~259 lines) — Stateless resolver
  for armament resolution, dice pool computation, Concentrate Fire dial/token
  detection, obstruction die removal, gather-dice hook application, damage
  calculation, and damage-card attack-blocking checks.  Every public method
  accepts `CombatParticipants` (and optionally `EffectRegistry`) as
  parameters — no stored mutable state.
- Public API: `resolve_armament()`, `compute_pool()`, `compute_dice_text()`,
  `compute_pool_for_parts()`, `apply_gather_hook()`,
  `is_blocked_by_damage()`, `is_blocked_by_damage_at_range()`,
  `get_cf_dial_colours()`, `has_cf_dial()`, `has_cf_token()`,
  `remove_obstruction_die()`, `calc_damage()`.
- AE wiring: 10 function bodies replaced with one-line delegations.
  UI side effects (panel updates, tooltip display) remain in AE.
- `attack_executor.gd` reduced from 3 013 → 2 929 lines (−84 net).

**New file:** `attack_dice_resolver.gd` (41 tests)
**Tests:** 95 scripts, 1 854 tests, 3 228 asserts — all passing.

#### F4c: DefenseTokenResolver ✅

Extracted all defense token computation from `attack_executor.gd`
into a new RefCounted class:

  for defense token availability checks, spend-method resolution, token
  effects (scatter, brace, evade remove/reroll, redirect validation),
  canonical sorting (Scatter→Evade→Brace→Redirect→Contain), and
  faceup damage card determination.  Every public method accepts the
  defender's ShipInstance and attack state as parameters — no stored
  mutable state.
- Public API: `count_lockable_tokens()`, `can_spend_tokens()`,
  `count_spendable_tokens()`, `is_token_spendable()`,
  `is_token_blocked_by_effect()`, `resolve_spend_method()`,

#### F4d: DamageDealer ✅

Extracted damage resolution computation from `attack_executor.gd`
into a new RefCounted class:

- **`src/core/damage_dealer.gd`** (220 lines) — Stateless helper for
  final damage calculation (scatter), shield absorption, hull tracking,
  destruction checks, ship/squadron damage planning, damage summary
  strings, card dealing decisions (faceup/facedown, persistent effect
  registration, immediate effect detection), and chooser player index
  for immediate-effect modals.
- Public API: `calculate_final_damage()`, `calculate_shield_absorption()`,
  `calculate_hull_remaining()`, `is_ship_destroyed()`,
  `is_squadron_destroyed()`, `plan_ship_damage()`,
  `plan_squadron_damage()`, `build_damage_summary()`,

**New file:** `damage_dealer.gd` (49 tests)
**Tests:** 97 scripts, 1 963 tests, 3 372 asserts — all passing.

### Refactoring Phase H — Targeting Geometry Centralisation ✅

**Goal:** Replace 6 inline geometry approximations with `RangeFinder` API
calls. Remove 2 dead-code files (`RangeMeasurer`, `FiringArc`). Add
skills rules to prevent recurrence.

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| H1 | Skills rules — § Single Source of Targeting Geometry | ✅ |
| H2 | Remove dead code (`range_measurer.gd`, `firing_arc.gd`) — −195 lines | ✅ |
| H3 | Fix `_any_enemy_squadron_in_range()` in SquadronPhaseController | ✅ |
| H4 | Fix `is_squadron_in_range()` in SquadronCommandResolver (widened factory) | ✅ |
| H5 | Fix 3 distance helpers in `targeting_list_builder.gd` | ✅ |
| H6 | Align `engagement_resolver.gd` `_edge_distance()` | ✅ |
| Bonus | Fix overlapping-circle edge case in `RangeFinder` | ✅ |

**Commit:** `198b200`
**Tests:** 99 scripts, 1 994 tests, 3 428 asserts — all passing.

### Refactoring Phase F5 — AttackExecutor Orchestration Split ✅

**Goal:** Split remaining AE orchestration (2 594 lines after F4d) into
focused components: shared state object, targeting list controller, and
target selection pipeline.

#### F5a: AttackState ✅

Created `src/core/attack_state.gd` (237 lines, RefCounted) — 37 member
variables grouped into 7 sections, 4 query helpers, 6 lifecycle methods.
38 unit tests.

#### F5b: Migrate AE Members → AttackState ✅

Replaced 40 member variables in AE with `_state: AttackState` reads/writes
(453 rename operations). Removed 147 lines of declarations. Rewrote 6
reset methods to delegate to `_state` lifecycle.
AE reduced from 2 938 → 2 594 lines (−344).

#### F5c: TargetingListController ✅

Created `src/scenes/game_board/targeting_list_controller.gd` (184 lines,
Node) owning targeting list modal lifecycle. Moved 7 methods (~105 lines)
from `game_board.gd`. GB reduced from 2 221 → 2 116 lines.

#### F5d: TargetSelector ✅

Created `src/scenes/game_board/target_selector.gd` (959 lines, Node)
owning the entire attacker/target selection pipeline shared by both the
free-form attack simulator and the real attack execution. Moved 43 methods
from AE. Divergence via `target_locked(range_band, dice_text)` signal.
AE reduced from 2 594 → 1 883 lines (−711).

**Commit:** `2d4d0a2`
**Tests:** 100 scripts, 2 032 tests, 3 552 asserts — all passing.

### Hotfix — Remove Escape Key from Attack Flow ✅

Removed `handle_escape()` from AttackExecutor, TargetSelector, and
TargetingListController. Escape routing for attack/targeting removed
from GameBoard. Escape during the attack flow was unused (other UI
buttons and keys serve that purpose) and caused an infinite loop when
combined with dice-phase guards.

**Commit:** `61be60e`
**Tests:** 100 scripts, 2 032 tests, 3 552 asserts — all passing.

### Hotfix — Fix Target Deselection Stuck State ✅

**Bug:** After selecting a target during attack execution (dice pool
computed, Roll button shown), clicking the target again to deselect
caused an unrecoverable stuck state. No further clicks were processed.

**Root cause:** The dice-phase guard in `_handle_target_ship_click()` and
`_handle_target_squadron_click()` checked `_state.dice_pool.size() > 0`,
which fires as soon as the pool is *computed* (before rolling). After
deselection, `dice_pool` remained populated, so every subsequent click
hit the guard and was silently discarded.

**Fix:**
1. Changed both guards from `dice_pool.size() > 0` to
   `dice_results.size() > 0` — only block clicks *after* dice are
   actually rolled (attack committed). Before rolling, the normal
   selection/deselection path handles target changes freely.
2. Simplified guards to hard block (no deselect branch needed post-roll
   since Escape is no longer available).
3. Added `_state.reset_dice()` + `reset_dice_ui()` in `_deselect_target()`
   when in exec mode with a computed pool — ensures stale pool/UI are
   cleaned up on pre-roll target changes.

**Files:** `target_selector.gd` (−17 lines, +15 lines)
**Tests:** 100 scripts, 2 032 tests, 3 552 asserts — all passing.

**Goal:** Allow the tester to press Shift+A (debug mode only) to enter a
free-text annotation. On confirm the full serialized GameState is saved
alongside annotation metadata to `saves/annotations/`, and the annotation
is logged. Toast notifications added for annotations, quicksave, and
quickload.

| # | Task | File(s) | Status |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | DebugToast widget — fade-in/hold/fade-out notification | `src/ui/debug_toast.gd` | ✅ |
| 2 | DebugAnnotationModal — text input modal | `src/ui/debug_annotation_modal.gd` | ✅ |
| 3 | Annotation save logic + Shift+A keybind | `src/autoload/debug_mode.gd` | ✅ |
| 4 | Toast on quicksave / quickload | `src/autoload/debug_mode.gd` | ✅ |
| 5 | DebugHelpPanel — Shift+A entry | `src/ui/debug_help_panel.gd` | ✅ |
| 6 | Unit tests | 3 test files (32 tests) | ✅ |

**New files:** `debug_toast.gd`, `debug_annotation_modal.gd` + `.uid` sidecars.
**Test files:** `test_debug_toast.gd`, `test_debug_annotation_modal.gd`,
`test_debug_annotation.gd`.
**Tests:** 100 scripts, 1 995 tests, 3 419 asserts — all passing.

### Playtest Bugfixes — Round 1–4 Annotations ✅

**Goal:** Fix 6 gameplay bugs discovered during a 4-round playtest session
with annotation snapshots. Bugs prioritised P1–P6.

| Priority | Bug | Fix Summary | File(s) | Status |
|----------|-----|-------------|---------|--------|
| P1 | E — Engaged squads attack ships | Engagement guard in ship/squad click validation; target filter when engaged | `attack_executor.gd`, `squadron_phase_controller.gd` | ✅ |
| P2 | B — Zero-dice zones highlight | Dice pool gate via `DicePool.get_attack_pool` + `get_total_count` | `attack_target_resolver.gd` | ✅ |
| P3 | F — Repair hull display stale | Emit `ship_hull_changed` after damage card removal | `repair_resolver.gd` | ✅ |
| P4 | D — Dial sprite persists | Call `hide_revealed_dial()` before `_activation_ctx.clear()` | `game_board.gd` | ✅ |
| P5 | C — Squad attack circle too large | Use `distance_bands_px[0]` instead of `range_close_px` | `attack_sim_overlay.gd` | ✅ |
| P6 | A — Sidebar squad highlight | Wire `highlight_active` callable into squadron phase controller | `squadron_phase_controller.gd`, `game_board.gd` | ✅ |

**New file:** `test_playtest_bugfixes.gd` (13 tests).
**Commit:** `cd154ff`
**Tests:** 101 scripts, 2 006 tests, 3 434 asserts — all passing.

### Post-A4 Bug Fixes — Attack Flow, Squadron Ghost, Modal Drift ✅

**Goal:** Fix three gameplay bugs found during post-refactoring playtesting.

| Task | Layer | Bug | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|-----|
| Attack flow stall on damage summary dismiss | Presentation | Dismissing overlay without selecting new target left attack panel hidden | Emit `dismissed` signal on early return; rename missing skin texture |
| Squadron ghost timing | Presentation | `set_activated_visual(true)` called after `EventBus` emit — board saw stale state | Move visual update before signal emit |
| Modal horizontal drift (ActivationModal + AttackSimPanel) | Presentation | `size = Vector2.ZERO` zeroed width; content inflation → left-edge preserved → centre shifted left ~20 px/cycle | Changed to `size.y = 0` (vertical only) in both `_build_ui()` and `_deferred_layout_reset()` |
| Learning scenario round-1 commands | Data | Commands updated to rules-compliant values | Updated `learning_scenario.json` + adjusted 6 unit tests |

**Tests:** 88 scripts, 1 652 tests, all passing (2 905 asserts).
**Documentation:** Updated `.skills/ui_styling.md` §10, `docs/arc42/08_crosscutting_concepts.md` §8.10, ADR-011.

---

### Phase 9.6: Wire Remaining Damage Card Effect Hooks ✅

**Goal:** Connect the 8 unresolved hooks so that all 22 damage card effects actually fire during gameplay. Fix the Projector Misaligned logic bug and the Crew Panic unregister gap.

**Status:** Complete — all 8 hooks wired, both bugs fixed, 16 new tests added. Tests: 1668 (88 scripts, 2929 asserts).

#### Missing Hook Wiring (8 hooks, 11 affected cards)

| # | Hook | Call Site Needed | Cards Affected | Complexity |
|---|------|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | `AFTER_MANEUVER_EXECUTE` | `game_board.gd` — after `mark_maneuver_executed()`, before `_show_end_activation_after_maneuver()` | Ruptured Engine (suffer 1 dmg if speed > 1), Damaged Controls (+1 facedown on overlap) | Medium — must deal facedown cards, update hull display, handle potential ship destruction |
| 2 | `MANEUVER_DETERMINE_YAWS` | `maneuver_tool_scene.gd` or wherever yaw array is computed | Thrust Control Malfunction (last adjustable joint −1 yaw) | Low — mutate yaw array before maneuver tool builds |
| 3 | `ON_SPEED_CHANGE` | `game_board.gd` or wherever speed dial is changed during maneuver | Thruster Fissure (suffer 1 dmg on any speed change) | Medium — must trigger from speed +/- buttons |
| 4 | `BEFORE_REVEAL_DIAL` | `game_board.gd` — at start of ship activation, before dial reveal | Crew Panic (suffer 1 dmg or discard dial) | High — requires player choice modal; dial discard changes command phase flow |
| 5 | `STATUS_READY_TOKENS` | `game_manager.gd` — `_begin_status_phase()` token-readying loop | Compartment Fire (cannot ready defense tokens) | Low — skip readying for affected ship |
| 6 | `ON_COMMAND_TOKEN_GAIN` | `game_manager.gd` — command token gain logic (dial convert, etc.) | Life Support Failure (cannot gain command tokens) | Low — cancel token gain |
| 7 | `ATTACK_VALIDATE_TARGET` | `attack_executor.gd` — target selection validation | Coolant Discharge (only 1 ship attack/round), Depowered Armament (no long range), Disengaged Fire Control (no obstructed) | Medium — needs cancel + tooltip feedback |
| 8 | `REPAIR_VALIDATE_SHIELD` | `repair_resolver.gd` — `recover_shields()` / `move_shields()` | Capacitor Failure (block shield ops on 0-shield zone) | Low — cancel if target zone has 0 shields |

#### Bug Fixes (2)

| # | Bug | Card | Current Behaviour | Correct Behaviour |
|---|-----|------|------------------|-------------------|
| B1 | **Projector Misaligned wrong logic** | Projector Misaligned | Reduces each zone's shields by 1 | Zone with **most** shields loses **all** shields; tied zones → owner choice |
| B2 | **Crew Panic self-discard leak** | Crew Panic | When player chooses to discard Crew Panic card instead of taking damage, the persistent effect is not unregistered from `EffectRegistry` | Must call `DamageCardEffectFactory.unregister_effect()` on self-discard |

#### Implementation Order

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Fix Projector Misaligned logic + update tests | ✅ |
| 2 | Wire `ATTACK_VALIDATE_TARGET` in attack_executor.gd | ✅ |
| 3 | Wire `REPAIR_VALIDATE_SHIELD` in repair_resolver.gd | ✅ |
| 4 | Wire `STATUS_READY_TOKENS` in game_manager.gd | ✅ |
| 5 | Wire `ON_COMMAND_TOKEN_GAIN` in game_manager.gd | ✅ |
| 6 | Wire `MANEUVER_DETERMINE_YAWS` in maneuver tool | ✅ |
| 7 | Wire `AFTER_MANEUVER_EXECUTE` in game_board.gd (Ruptured Engine + Damaged Controls) | ✅ |
| 8 | Wire `ON_SPEED_CHANGE` in speed change handler | ✅ |
| 9 | Wire `BEFORE_REVEAL_DIAL` in activation start + add choice modal for Crew Panic | ✅ |
| 10 | Fix Crew Panic self-discard unregister bug | ✅ |
| 11 | Integration tests: pipeline tests for all 8 hooks | ✅ |

#### Wiring Status Summary (current → target)

| Metric | Before | After Phase 9.6 |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Hooks wired | 6 / 14 | **14 / 14** ✅ |
| Cards fully working | 13 / 22 | **22 / 22** ✅ |
| Bugs | 2 | **0** ✅ |

### Phase 9.7: Debug Faceup Damage Dealing (Shift+D) ✅

**Goal:** Add a debug-mode keyboard shortcut (Shift+D) that lets the tester deal any of the 22 faceup damage cards to a clicked ship, bypassing combat. Accelerates manual testing of all damage card effects.

**Requirements:** DBG-050, DBG-051, DBG-052

#### Implementation Steps

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Add `_debug_damage_targeting: bool` state + Shift+D handler in `game_board.gd` | ✅ |
| 2 | Route ship click to damage card choice modal when targeting | ✅ |
| 3 | On card choice: draw from deck, override effect_id/title, deal faceup with full pipeline | ✅ |
| 4 | Escape cancels targeting mode | ✅ |
| 5 | Update `DebugHelpPanel` with Shift+D entry under "Cheats" section | ✅ |
| 6 | Add requirement DBG-050–052 | ✅ |
| 7 | Add MT-9.7.01 manual test scenario | ✅ |

**Commit:** `53fed22` → Phase 9.7 complete

#### Bugfixes applied post-merge

| Fix | Description | Commit |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Modal spacing | Reduced OpponentChoiceModal content VBox separation 12→6, button min height 36→24 | `2f0bf64` |
| Comm Noise effect_text | `_debug_deal_faceup_card()` now loads correct `effect_text` from `damage_cards.json` when overriding card identity | (this commit) |
| Crew Panic timing | Moved Crew Panic check from drop time to **before drag starts** in `_on_dial_drag_started()`. Eliminated 5 interrelated bugs (modal too late, drag cancelled during modal, null state in callback, double-click needed, no effect after confirm). | (this commit) |
| Crew Panic logic | Crew Panic is persistent — choosing "discard dial" sets a flag and spends the dial instead of removing the card. Card stays faceup and fires every round. | (this commit) |
| Crew Panic text | Modal now reads "discard that dial" (not "discard this card") per corrected rules text | (this commit) |

### Refactoring Phase G — Command Pattern (Multiplayer Foundation) 🔄

**Goal:** Introduce the Command pattern so every player-initiated action is a
serializable, validatable, replayable object. Enables: network multiplayer,
deterministic replay, save/load mid-game, automated regression via full-game
replay files.

**Reference:** `docs/refactoring_plan.md` § Phase G

#### G5: Deterministic RNG ✅

Replaced `randi()` in `Dice.roll_die()`, `Dice.roll_pool()`, and
`DamageDeck.shuffle()` with a seeded `RandomNumberGenerator` instance
exposed through the new `GameRng` class (`RefCounted`, instantiated per
`GameState`). The seed is stored in `GameState.rng` and propagated to
saved games via serialization.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `GameRng` class (`src/core/game_rng.gd`, RefCounted) with `seed`, `randi_range()`, `generate_seed()` | ✅ |
| 2 | Wire `Dice.roll_die()` + `Dice.roll_pool()` through `GameRng` | ✅ |
| 3 | Wire `DamageDeck.shuffle()` through `GameRng` | ✅ |
| 4 | Unit tests (sequence determinism, reseed, range checks) | ✅ |

**Commit:** `621b8b2`
**Tests:** 101 scripts, 2 033 tests, 3 553 asserts — all passing.

#### G1 + G3: GameCommand Base + CommandProcessor Autoload ✅

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `GameCommand` base class (`src/core/game_command.gd`) — `execute()`, `validate()`, `serialize()`, `describe()`, static registry with `register_type()` / `deserialize()` | ✅ |
| 2 | `CommandProcessor` autoload (`src/autoload/command_processor.gd`) — `submit()` pipeline (validate → sequence → execute → record → emit), `get_history()`, `reset()`, `serialize_history()`, `replay_commands()` | ✅ |
| 3 | Unit tests: 12 for GameCommand, 9 for CommandProcessor | ✅ |

**Note:** Godot 4.5 limitation — `CommandProcessor` cannot declare `class_name`
because it conflicts with autoload singleton registration. Tests use
`const CmdProcessor := preload(...)` instead.

**Commit:** `9d52bce`
**Tests:** 103 scripts, 2 063 tests, 3 685 asserts — all passing.

#### G2 Tier 1: Concrete Command Classes ✅

Six command subclasses covering all non-attack state-modifying player actions:

| Command Class | Replaces | Phase Guard |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| `AssignDialCommand` | `CommandDialStack.assign_dials()` | COMMAND |
| `ActivateShipCommand` | `GameManager.activate_ship()` | SHIP |
| `EndActivationCommand` | `GameManager._on_activation_ended()` | SHIP |
| `ConvertDialToTokenCommand` | `GameManager.activate_ship_as_token()` | SHIP |
| `ActivateSquadronCommand` | `GameManager.activate_squadron()` | SQUADRON |
| `SpendTokenCommand` | `CommandTokenManager.spend_token()` | — |

All classes in `src/core/commands/`. Each has `validate()`, `execute()`,
`serialize()`, and `describe()` with full static typing and doc comments.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `GameState.get_ship()` + `find_ship_index()` helpers | ✅ |
| 2 | 6 command class files | ✅ |
| 3 | 35 unit tests (validate/execute/serialize per command) | ✅ |

**Commit:** `158fa91`
**Tests:** 104 scripts, 2 098 tests, 3 721 asserts — all passing.

#### Remaining G2 Tiers (not yet started)

| Tier | Commands | Blocked By |
|------|----------|------------|
| Tier 2 | `RollDiceCommand`, `SpendDefenseTokenCommand`, `SelectRedirectZoneCommand`, `SkipAttackCommand` | Attack pipeline integration |
| Tier 3 | `MoveSquadronCommand`, `ExecuteManeuverCommand` | Positional data serialization |

#### G4: Network Transport Layer ⏳

Uses Godot `MultiplayerPeer` API. Depends on G2 wiring completion.

#### G6: GameReplay ⏳

Record/playback of serialized command sequences. Depends on G2 wiring + G5.

#### Phase G Metrics

| Metric | Before Phase G | After G5+G1+G3+G2T1 |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Test scripts | 100 | 104 |
| Tests | 2 032 | 2 098 |
| Asserts | 3 552 | 3 721 |
| Autoloads | 11 | 12 (+ CommandProcessor) |
| Command classes | 0 | 7 (1 base + 6 concrete) |

## Architecture Hooks for Future Stages

Per `docs/requirements/future_stages.md` Priority 1, these hooks are built during MVP even though not fully used:

| Hook | Built In Phase | Used By (Future) |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| `AttackPipeline` as callable function | Phase 6 | Salvo, Counter (reentrant attacks) |
| Effect timing points in attack steps | Phase 6 | Upgrade card effects |
| Effect timing points in movement | Phase 5b | Upgrade card effects on movement |
| Geometry primitives (intersection, overlap) | Phase 1 | LOS system |
| Complete state serialization | Phase 3 + 10 | Network multiplayer, save/load |
| GameCommand + CommandProcessor | Phase G (G1+G3) | Network multiplayer, replay | ✅ Base class + autoload + 6 Tier 1 commands |
| Deterministic RNG (GameRng) | Phase G (G5) | Replay determinism, network sync | ✅ Seeded RNG in Dice + DamageDeck |
| Ship hull zone list as configurable | Phase 1 | Huge ships (6 hull zones) |
| Keyword resolution as pluggable system | Phase 7 | Extended squadron keywords | ✅ EffectRegistry + GameEffect pipeline |
| Damage card effect pattern | Phase 9, 9.6 | Upgrade card effects (same pattern) | ✅ DamageCardEffect + DamageCardEffectFactory + 14/14 hooks wired |

#### Phase 9.7 metrics

| Metric | Before | After Phase 9.7 |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Test scripts | 88 | 88 |
| Tests | 1668 | 1668 |
| Asserts | 2931 | 2931 |
