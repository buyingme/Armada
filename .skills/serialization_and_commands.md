## 1. Golden Rule — State That Changes Must Serialize

**If a class holds mutable game state, it MUST implement
`serialize() -> Dictionary` and `static deserialize(data) -> Self`.**

Before adding a field to any class in `src/core/` or `src/models/`:

1. Ask: *"Would this field need to survive a save/load cycle or replay?"*
2. If **yes** → add the field to both `serialize()` and `deserialize()`.
3. If **no** (transient UI cache, etc.) → document with `## Transient — not serialized.`

**Enforcement:** Never merge a class that stores game state without both methods.
If you are extending an existing class with a new field, update its
`serialize()` and `deserialize()` in the **same edit**.

### Classes That Must Be Serializable

| Class | Location | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `GameState` | `src/core/game_state.gd` | ✅ |
| `PlayerState` | `src/core/player_state.gd` | ✅ |
| `ShipInstance` | `src/core/ship_instance.gd` | ✅ |
| `SquadronInstance` | `src/core/squadron_instance.gd` | ✅ |
| `DamageDeck` | `src/core/damage_deck.gd` | ✅ |
| `DamageCard` | `src/core/damage_card.gd` | ✅ |
| `ShipActivationState` | `src/core/ship_activation_state.gd` | ✅ |
| `CommandDialStack` | `src/core/command_dial_stack.gd` | ✅ |
| `CommandTokenManager` | `src/core/command_token_manager.gd` | ✅ |
| `GameRng` | `src/core/game_rng.gd` | ✅ |
| `InteractionFlow` (Phase I) | `src/core/state/interaction_flow.gd` | ⏳ planned — see `docs/refactoring_phase_i_plan.md` |

Any **new** class added to `src/core/` or `src/models/` that holds mutable
state must be added to this table.

## 2. Serialization Contract

### 2.1 Method Signatures

```gdscript
## Serializes this object to a JSON-safe Dictionary.
func serialize() -> Dictionary:

## Reconstructs the object from a serialized Dictionary.
## [param data] — Dictionary produced by [method serialize].
## Static data (e.g. ShipData resource) is passed separately.
static func deserialize(data: Dictionary, ...) -> Self:
```

### 2.2 Mandatory Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Every mutable field appears in both `serialize()` and `deserialize()` | Round-trip integrity |
| `deserialize()` uses `.get(key, default)` — never bare `data[key]` | Forward-compatible with older saves |
| Enum values are stored as `int()`, cast back with `as Constants.EnumType` | JSON has no enum type |
| Nested serializable objects call their own `serialize()`/`deserialize()` | Recursive composition |
| Static reference data (e.g. `ShipData`) is identified by `data_key` string, not serialized inline | Keeps payloads small; the loader resolves keys to resources |
| Arrays of serializable objects map each element through `serialize()`/`deserialize()` | Preserves order and type |
| No `Vector2`, `Color`, or other Godot types in serialized dicts — use plain floats/ints | JSON portability |

### 2.3 Template — Adding a Field to an Existing Serializable Class

When adding `my_new_field: int` to `ShipInstance`:

```gdscript
# 1. Declare the field
var my_new_field: int = 0

# 2. Add to serialize()
func serialize() -> Dictionary:
    return {
        # ... existing keys ...
        "my_new_field": my_new_field,
    }

# 3. Add to deserialize() — always with a safe default
static func deserialize(data: Dictionary, ...) -> ShipInstance:
    inst.my_new_field = int(data.get("my_new_field", 0))
```

**Forgetting step 2 or 3 is a bug.** Tests must cover the round-trip.

### 2.4 Template — New Serializable Class

```gdscript
class_name MyNewState
extends RefCounted

var value_a: int = 0
var value_b: String = ""

func serialize() -> Dictionary:
    return {
        "value_a": value_a,
        "value_b": value_b,
    }

static func deserialize(data: Dictionary) -> MyNewState:
    var inst := MyNewState.new()
    inst.value_a = int(data.get("value_a", 0))
    inst.value_b = data.get("value_b", "") as String
    return inst
```

---

## 3. Normalised Position Pattern

All spatial data on game tokens uses **normalised coordinates**:

| Field | Type | Range | Meaning |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| `pos_x` | `float` | 0.0 – 1.0 | Horizontal position (0 = left edge, 1 = right edge) |
| `pos_y` | `float` | 0.0 – 1.0 | Vertical position (0 = top edge, 1 = bottom edge) |
| `rotation_deg` | `float` | degrees | Rotation (0 = facing up / −Y, 180 = facing down / +Y) |

This pattern is used consistently in:
- **Scenario JSON** (`learning_scenario.json` → `tokens[].pos_x`, `.pos_y`, `.rotation_deg`)
- **TokenPlacement** (`src/models/token_placement.gd`)
- **ShipInstance** (`src/core/ship_instance.gd`)
- **SquadronInstance** (`src/core/squadron_instance.gd`)
- **Command payloads** (`execute_maneuver`, `move_squadron`)

### 3.1 Why Normalised?

- **Board-size independent** — the same 0.0–1.0 values work on a 3′×3′ learning
  board and a 6′×3′ standard board.
- **JSON-safe** — plain floats, no Godot types.
- **Human-readable** — `0.5, 0.5` is obviously centre.

### 3.2 Converting to Pixels

Pixel conversion always uses `play_area_size: Vector2` (width × height):

```gdscript
func get_pixel_position(play_area_size: Vector2) -> Vector2:
    return Vector2(pos_x, pos_y) * play_area_size
```

`GameScale.play_area_size_px` provides the authoritative `Vector2`.
Never use a single `float` for pixel conversion — that assumes a square board.

### 3.3 Converting from Pixels to Normalised

When saving positions back to normalised form (e.g. `ScenarioSaver`):

```gdscript
var norm_x: float = pixel_pos.x / play_area_size.x
var norm_y: float = pixel_pos.y / play_area_size.y
```

Divide X by width, Y by height — **never by a single side length**.

### 3.4 Banned Position Patterns

- ❌ Storing pixel positions in serialized data
- ❌ Using `Vector2` directly in JSON dictionaries
- ❌ Dividing by `play_area_side_px` (single float) for normalisation
- ❌ Multiplying by `play_area_side_px` (single float) for de-normalisation
- ❌ Hardcoding board pixel dimensions in commands or models

## 4. Command System

### 4.1 Architecture

```
UI → creates GameCommand subclass → CommandProcessor.submit()
                                        ├─ validate(game_state) → reject or continue
                                        ├─ assign sequence number
                                        ├─ execute(game_state) → result Dict
                                        ├─ record in history
                                        └─ emit command_executed signal → UI reacts
```

**Every game-state mutation flows through a command.** No direct writes to
`GameState` from UI or scene code.

### 4.2 Command Contract

Every command subclass **must** provide:

| Method | Signature | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `register()` | `static func register() -> void` | Registers factory in `GameCommand._registry` |
| `_init()` | `func _init(p_player, p_payload) -> void` | Calls `super._init(player, TYPE_STRING, payload)` |
| `validate()` | `func validate(game_state: GameState) -> String` | Returns `""` if legal, error message if not |
| `execute()` | `func execute(game_state: GameState) -> Dictionary` | Mutates game_state, returns result dict |

Inherited from `GameCommand` (do NOT re-implement):

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `serialize()` | Produces `{"type", "player", "sequence", "payload"}` |
| `deserialize()` | Dispatches to correct subclass via `_registry` |
| `describe()` | Human-readable log string |

### 4.3 Command Template

```gdscript
## ShortDescription
##
## [Brief description of what this command does.]
## Rules Reference: "[Section]", [detail], p.[N]
class_name MyNewCommand
extends GameCommand


## Registers this command type with the GameCommand factory.
static func register() -> void:
    GameCommand.register_type("my_command_type", func(player: int,
            pl: Dictionary) -> GameCommand:
        return MyNewCommand.new(player, pl))


func _init(p_player: int = 0, p_payload: Dictionary = {}) -> void:
    super._init(p_player, "my_command_type", p_payload)


## Payload keys: key_a (int), key_b (String), ...


## Validates the command against the current game state.
func validate(game_state: GameState) -> String:
    var base: String = super.validate(game_state)
    if base != "":
        return base
    # Phase check
    if game_state.current_phase != Constants.GamePhase.EXPECTED:
        return "Not in expected phase."
    # Entity existence
    if not payload.has("required_key"):
        return "Missing required_key."
    return ""


## Executes the command, mutating game_state.
func execute(game_state: GameState) -> Dictionary:
    # Read payload
    var key_a: int = int(payload.get("key_a", 0))
    # Mutate state
    # ...
    # Return result
    return {"key_a": key_a, "success": true}
```

### 4.4 Command Registration

Every new command **must** be registered in `CommandProcessor._ready()`:

```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
    # ... existing registrations ...
    MyNewCommand.register()
```

Forgetting this step causes `GameCommand.deserialize()` to return `null`
for the command type, silently breaking replay.

### 4.5 Command Payload Rules

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Payloads are plain `Dictionary` — JSON-safe types only | `{"ship_index": 0, "pos_x": 0.5}` |
| Use primitives: `int`, `float`, `String`, `bool`, `Array`, `Dictionary` | Never `Vector2`, `Resource`, `Node` |
| Identify entities by index, not by reference | `"ship_index": 2`, not a ShipInstance pointer |
| Position data uses normalised `pos_x`/`pos_y`/`rotation_deg` | See §3 |
| Enum values stored as `int` | `"phase": int(Constants.GamePhase.SHIP)` |
| Validate all required keys in `validate()` | `if not payload.has("key"): return "Missing key."` |

### 4.6 State Mutation Rules

Commands are the **only** sanctioned way to mutate `GameState` during gameplay:

- ❌ Scene code writing directly to `ShipInstance.current_hull`
- ❌ UI code modifying `GameState.current_phase`
- ❌ Any code path that changes game state outside `execute()`
- ✅ `execute()` method on a `GameCommand` subclass
- ✅ `GameManager` phase transitions (these will become commands too)

If you need to change game state, **write a command**. If a command for the
action does not exist yet, create one following the template in §4.3.

### 4.7 Commands and Position Data

When a command produces a new position (movement, deployment, etc.):

1. The command payload carries `pos_x`, `pos_y`, `rotation_deg` (normalised).
2. `validate()` checks `payload.has("pos_x")` and `payload.has("pos_y")`.
3. `execute()` writes the normalised values to the model instance:
   ```gdscript
   ship.pos_x = float(payload.get("pos_x", 0.0))
   ship.pos_y = float(payload.get("pos_y", 0.0))
   ship.rotation_deg = float(payload.get("rotation_deg", 0.0))
   ```
4. The presentation layer converts to pixels using `get_pixel_position(GameScale.play_area_size_px)`.

**Never store pixel positions in command payloads.** They are board-size
dependent and would break replay on different display configurations.

### 4.8 Post-Execute Signal Contract

Commands only mutate `GameState` — they do **not** emit EventBus signals.
The **presentation-layer caller** is responsible for emitting every signal
that the UI needs after `execute()` returns.

When a command deals damage, the caller must emit **all** of:

| Signal | Purpose | Listener |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `damage_card_dealt` | Refresh ship card panel facedown/faceup indicators | `ShipCardPanel` |
| `ship_hull_changed` | Update hull label on ship token | `ShipToken` |
| `ship_damaged` | Trigger damage animation / SFX | `SfxManager` |
| `ship_destroyed` + `_fade_out_destroyed_token()` | Remove token from board | `GameBoard` |

Omitting any signal causes a presentation desync (e.g. facedown card not
visible until the panel is manually re-opened, or ship staying on the board
at 0 hull).

**Checklist after writing a command caller:**

1. Did I emit `damage_card_dealt` for each card added?
2. Did I emit `ship_hull_changed` with the new hull value?
3. Did I check `result.get("destroyed", false)` and emit `ship_destroyed`?
4. Did I call the fade-out visual for destroyed tokens?

If a command can be called from **multiple** presentation sites
(e.g. `game_board.gd` and `maneuver_tool_scene.gd`), centralise the
post-execute signal logic in **one** place (typically `game_board.gd`) and
inject it as a `Callable` into the other site — see §4.9.

### 4.9 Callable Injection for Cross-Scene Command Callers

When a child scene (e.g. `ManeuverToolScene`) needs to trigger a command
that requires signals only the parent (`GameBoard`) can emit properly
(because it owns the token references, fade-out helpers, etc.), inject
the parent's handler as a `Callable`:

```gdscript
# Parent (game_board.gd) — owns the canonical handler:
func _submit_persistent_damage(ship: ShipInstance, eff_id: String) -> void:
    # ... submit command, emit ALL signals, handle destruction ...

# Pass it when creating the child:
maneuver_tool.set_activation_mode(state, _submit_persistent_damage)

# Child (maneuver_tool_scene.gd) — stores and calls:
var _persistent_damage_handler: Callable

### 4.10 Network Interaction State Contract (G4.6.6+)

For networked step-by-step UI flows (activation, attack, displacement),
`GameState` mutations and interaction progression must remain consistent.

#### Required fields

`NetworkInteractionState` payloads must include at least:
- `flow_type: String`
- `step_id: String`
- `controller_player: int`
- `visible_to: String`
- `payload: Dictionary`
- `version: int` (monotonic per match)

#### Ordering and idempotency rules

1. Apply `command_result` by sequence number (`seq`) order.
2. Apply interaction updates by `version` order.
3. Ignore duplicate `seq`/`version` values (idempotent no-op).
4. If interaction step `version=N` depends on command `seq=M`, do not
    render the step until `seq=M` has been applied.

#### Reconnection rule

A reconnect snapshot must restore both:
- serialized `GameState`
- current `NetworkInteractionState`

Input remains disabled until both are applied.

#### Privacy invariant (command phase)

Hidden dial contents must never be present in opponent-facing payloads.
Add negative tests for leakage in:
- snapshot dictionaries
- command result payloads
- UI event payload dictionaries

func _on_speed_change_hook_triggered(ship: ShipInstance, eff_id: String) -> void:
    if _persistent_damage_handler.is_valid():
        _persistent_damage_handler.call(ship, eff_id)
```

This keeps the child focused on interaction logic while the parent retains
single responsibility for damage/destruction signalling.

❌ **Never** duplicate the signal-emitting helper in multiple scenes.
❌ **Never** have a child scene emit `ship_destroyed` directly — it lacks
   the `ShipToken` reference needed for the fade-out.

---

## 5. Replay System

### 5.1 Architecture

```
CommandProcessor._history  →  serialize_history()  →  GameReplay
                                                          ├─ header (metadata)
                                                          └─ commands (Array[Dictionary])
                                                               ├─ save_to_file() → JSON
                                                               └─ load_from_file() → GameReplay
                                                                     └─ replay_commands() → re-submit
```

Replay depends on **deterministic execution**: same seed + same command
sequence = identical game state. This is why:

- `GameRng` is seeded and serialized (see `game_rng.gd`).
- Commands carry all information needed to reproduce the action.
- No randomness occurs outside `GameRng`.
- No side channel data (pixel positions, UI state) leaks into game logic.

### 5.2 Replay-Safe Checklist

When adding a new feature, verify:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Command exists | Does the feature mutate state? → Must go through a command |
| Payload is complete | Does the command payload contain everything needed to replay the action without UI? |
| No hidden state | Does `execute()` read anything beyond `game_state` + `payload`? It must not |
| RNG usage | Does the feature use randomness? → Must use `game_state.rng`, never `randf()`/`randi()` |
| Position format | Does the command carry positions? → Must be `pos_x`/`pos_y`/`rotation_deg` (normalised) |

---

## 6. Scenario Data

Scenarios define initial board state in JSON:

```json
{
    "scenario_name": "Learning Scenario",
    "map_image": "map_3x3_distant_planet_v3.jpg",
    "tokens": [
        {
            "key": "victory_ii_class_star_destroyer",
            "type": "ship",
            "pos_x": 0.489,
            "pos_y": 0.123,
            "rotation_deg": 180.0
        }
    ]
}
```

### 6.1 Scenario JSON Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Positions are normalised (`pos_x`, `pos_y`: 0.0–1.0) | Board-size independent |
| Rotation is in degrees (`rotation_deg`) | 0 = up, 180 = down |
| Tokens identified by `key` (matches `data_key` in ship/squadron JSON) | Never by display name |
| `type` is `"ship"` or `"squadron"` | Used to dispatch to correct loader |
| No pixel values in scenario files | Pixels are presentation-layer only |

### 6.2 Loading Flow

```
scenario JSON → AssetLoader.load_json()
    → parse tokens[] → TokenPlacement objects
        → ShipInstance / SquadronInstance (pos_x, pos_y, rotation_deg copied)
            → ShipToken / SquadronToken (get_pixel_position(GameScale.play_area_size_px))
```

---

## 7. Testing Serialization

### 7.1 Round-Trip Tests Are Mandatory

Every serializable class **must** have a round-trip test:

```gdscript
func test_serialize_deserialize_round_trip() -> void:
    # Arrange
    var original := MyClass.new()
    original.field_a = 42
    original.field_b = "hello"

    # Act
    var data: Dictionary = original.serialize()
    var restored := MyClass.deserialize(data)

    # Assert
    assert_eq(restored.field_a, 42, "field_a survives round-trip")
    assert_eq(restored.field_b, "hello", "field_b survives round-trip")
```

### 7.2 Command Tests Are Mandatory

Every command **must** have tests covering:

| Test | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| Validation passes for valid input | `assert_eq(cmd.validate(state), "")` |
| Validation rejects invalid input | `assert_ne(cmd.validate(state), "")` |
| Execute produces correct result | `var result := cmd.execute(state); assert_eq(...)` |
| Execute mutates state correctly | Check model fields after execute |
| Serialize/deserialize round-trip | `GameCommand.deserialize(cmd.serialize())` preserves type + payload |
| Position written to model (for movement commands) | `assert_eq(instance.pos_x, expected)` after execute |

### 7.3 Position Tests Must Use Asymmetric Board Size

To catch square-board assumptions, always test `get_pixel_position()` with
a non-square `Vector2`:

```gdscript
# GOOD — catches width==height bugs
var px: Vector2 = instance.get_pixel_position(Vector2(1000.0, 800.0))
assert_eq(px.x, 500.0, "X uses width")   # 0.5 * 1000
assert_eq(px.y, 200.0, "Y uses height")  # 0.25 * 800

# BAD — passes even if X and Y are swapped
var px: Vector2 = instance.get_pixel_position(Vector2(1000.0, 1000.0))
```

---

## 8. Banned Patterns — Serialization & Commands

These will be flagged during code review. Never generate code that does any
of these:

| Banned Pattern | Why | Correct Alternative |
|---------------|-----|---------------------|
| ❌ Mutable game-state field without `serialize()`/`deserialize()` | Breaks save/load and replay | Add to both methods in the same edit |
| ❌ `data["key"]` without `.get()` default in `deserialize()` | Crashes on older save files | `data.get("key", default)` |
| ❌ `Vector2` / `Color` in serialized dictionaries | Not JSON-safe | Use separate float keys (`pos_x`, `pos_y`) |
| ❌ Pixel values in command payloads or serialized state | Board-size dependent, breaks replay portability | Use normalised 0.0–1.0 coordinates |
| ❌ Entity references (Node, Resource, RefCounted) in payloads | Not serializable | Use index (`ship_index`) or key (`data_key`) |
| ❌ Mutating `GameState` outside a `GameCommand.execute()` | Breaks replay determinism | Write a command |
| ❌ Using `randf()` / `randi()` for game logic | Non-deterministic, breaks replay | Use `game_state.rng` |
| ❌ `play_area_side_px` (float) in `get_pixel_position()` | Assumes square board | Use `play_area_size_px` (Vector2) |
| ❌ Command without `register()` call in `CommandProcessor._ready()` | Breaks deserialization and replay | Add registration in `_ready()` |
| ❌ Command without `validate()` checking required payload keys | Silent failures on bad data | Check every required key with `payload.has()` |
| ❌ New serializable class without round-trip test | No proof the contract works | Write the test alongside the class |
